    "description": "Hedera coin (HBAR) was among the top-performing assets last year as it surged nearly 850% between November to January.

    "full_content": "Hedera coin (HBAR) was among the top-performing assets last year as it surged nearly 850% between November to January. It went from a low of $0.04 before Trump’s victory to a high of $0.37 when he took oath. It deleted a zero with ease and investors who accumulated the token early made massive profits in a short time. However, like many altcoins, HBAR has had a slow start to 2025 and is down nearly 20% in the last month alone.\n\nHBAR is now trading at the $0.18 mark on Tuesday and is attracting bearish sentiments. It is down close to 4% in the day’s trade and showing no signs of a bullish trajectory. Can Hedera coin dust itself from the fall and begin to steadily climb up in the indices? How may the coin perform for the remainder of this year?\n\n\n\nHow High Will Hedera HBAR Go in 2025?\n\nThe US SEC is currently mulling over announcing approvals to a spree of ETF applications that it has in store for investors. In the latest development, the US SEC has acknowledged Grayscale’s Hedera (HBAR) ETF, giving a more speculative narrative for investors to explore and develop. At the same time, the US SEC has delayed the approvals of leading ETFs until May 2025, possibly on account of deep contemplation and research as well as to figure out the best strategic plan of success before officially approving the ETF for the investors to explore and trade with.\n\nPrice Prediction platform CoinCodex doesn’t see much further growth for Hedera HBAR this year. According to the analysts, the highest HBAR may go will come this summer, where it could hit a high of $ 0.147666. That would represent an approximate ROI of 20% from current prices.\n\nAlso Read: US Dollar Drops 4.7% in 2025: What’s Next for Your Portfolio?\n\nA different price prediction for Hedera’s HBAR is much more bullish coming from Telegaon. Telagaon projects HBAR reaching a $0.59 average price in 2025, with a maximum value of $0.78. This is a nearly 400% climb from HBAR’s current prices."

With recession fears growing, investors are looking for safe options in growing sectors to invest in, namely in the tech industry. According to experts at JPMorgan, the Facebook creator could become the top stock option amongst internet-based companies.\n\nIndeed, J.P. Morgan has named Meta Platforms’ META stock among its top picks in the internet sector amid tough economic conditions. Analyst Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan also recently reiterated his Buy rating on META stock at a price target of $725. This implies an ROI of 25% from current levels. The analyst cites META’s AI dominance and the upcoming Llama 4 launch, which is set to boost monetization and long-term growth. Additionally, the bank emphasized Meta’s massive advertiser base, noting that the company has tens of millions of advertisers, with over 80% of its ad revenue coming from performance and direct response (DR) advertising.\n\nFurther, JP Morgan expects Meta’s 2025 revenue growth to be fueled by AI-driven optimizations, core improvements, and video unification efforts. While Meta has issued more conservative guidance on the company’s upcoming Q1 2025 earnings, most analysts agree that META is one of the more promising tech stocks among the Mag-7, especially compared to other internet-focused stock options.\n\nAlso Read: Tesla Stock Drops 51% as Violent Attacks on Dealerships Spike—Is Musk’s Politics to Blame?\n\nAnalysts from Wolfe Research also are raising their projections for META stock in the near future. The analysts suggest that Meta’s business messaging opportunity could generate $30-40 billion in revenue. The firm believes this “modest near-term upside” could positively impact Meta’s FY25/26 Other-FOA revenue estimates beyond the previous conservative guidance. Additionally, Wolfe Research believes that the medium-term opportunity is even more promising, with the analysts predicting “a high-single-digit to low-double-digit billion-dollar incremental revenue opportunity” in the coming years. This growth could increase Meta’s platform stickiness, making an investment into META stock much more promising as that market continues to expand.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, META stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 48 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 44 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. The average META price target from TipRanks is $763.71, implying a 31.14% upside from current prices. CNN data reveals similar optimism. Over the next year, CNN projects META stock to trade at a Median of $775.00, reflecting 32% ROI potential."
