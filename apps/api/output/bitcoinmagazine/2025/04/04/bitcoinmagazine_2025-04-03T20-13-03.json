    "full_content": "# Bill Miller IV Reveals Firm’s Investment in GME, Touts Bitcoin Treasury Strategy\n\nBill Miller IV backs GameStop and Strategy, calling Bitcoin treasury strategy a smart long-term play against fiat debasement.\n\nAuthor: Nick Ward | Date: April 2, 2025\n\nCategories: BITCOIN FOR CORPORATIONS, NEWS\n\nIn a recent interview, Bill Miller IV outlined his firm’s investment approach in a rapidly shifting macro environment, spotlighting GameStop as a new position and reiterating strong conviction in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) as the blueprint for Bitcoin treasury strategy. For Miller, corporate Bitcoin strategy is more than a hedge—it’s a signal of innovation, adaptability, and capital efficiency.\n\n### Strategy: Solving Corporate Finance Problems with Bitcoin\n\nMiller praised Strategy’s transformation from software company to capital allocator focused on Bitcoin. He emphasized that the company isn’t just investing in Bitcoin—it’s solving traditional corporate finance challenges through Bitcoin-backed innovation. Strategy continues to create access to Bitcoin across the capital stack, offering various instruments with different risk profiles—from equity to convertible notes.\n\nWhile some view the firm’s market premium as excessive, Miller sees it as deserved. He framed Strategy’s persistent accumulation of Bitcoin through share issuance as an intelligent response to monetary debasement and a model that others have yet to replicate effectively.\n\nHe also noted that the rebrand from MicroStrategy to Strategy marked a shift not just in name, but in purpose—cementing the company’s identity as a Bitcoin development company.\n\n### Not Every Company Can Be Strategy—But Many Can Start\n\nAccording to Miller, there’s a growing list of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets—more than 70 by his count—but his firm only invests in a select few. He emphasized that his team evaluates each one on its own merits, with a value-oriented lens and a clear focus on the core business.\n\nWhile not every company can become a Bitcoin development company like Strategy, Miller believes many can and should adopt Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. He described Bitcoin as a way for companies to preserve the purchasing power of their excess capital, especially in light of monetary policies designed to erode fiat value over time.\n\nHe emphasized that companies facing secular challenges—such as declining core businesses or structural industry shifts—may find in Bitcoin a meaningful way to preserve relevance and shareholder value.\n\n### New Position: GameStop Signals Memetic and Strategic Potential\n\nMiller confirmed a new starter position in GameStop, explaining that the decision was driven by the company’s recent capital raise and signs that it may be exploring a Bitcoin strategy. Though the position is small, it reflects his firm’s broader interest in companies that show signs of innovation and unorthodox capital allocation.\n\nHe highlighted Ryan Cohen’s role at GameStop as a potentially powerful catalyst, pointing to Cohen’s cultural influence and willingness to think outside traditional finance norms. The ability to shape narratives, Miller suggested, is increasingly important in a world where memetics and capital markets are intertwined.\n\nHe sees potential for GameStop to follow a path similar to Metaplanet or Strategy—retail businesses that have embraced Bitcoin in response to broader existential challenges.\n\n### Bitcoin as the Rational Response to Monetary Debasement\n\nMiller made the case for Bitcoin adoption as a response to ongoing monetary debasement. He explained that if policymakers openly target 2% annual inflation—or more—then it is rational for companies and individuals to move an equivalent portion of their fiat-denominated capital into Bitcoin.\n\nHe stressed that this isn’t a speculative move but a fundamental capital preservation strategy. The key, he noted, is holding Bitcoin over the long term and recognizing it as a way to transfer value into the future with a lower risk of purchasing power erosion.\n\nMiller also noted that more companies are waking up to this logic, especially as regulatory clarity improves. He expects adoption to continue accelerating and sees the current period as a pivotal moment for CFOs and corporate treasurers to take action.\n\n### A Call to Forward-Thinking Financial Leaders\n\nFor Miller, Bitcoin isn’t a temporary trade—it’s a long-term solution to structural problems in fiat finance. He believes corporate leaders who ignore this trend risk falling behind. The momentum, he says, is clear: more public companies are entering the space, and early adopters are beginning to outperform.\n\nStrategy remains the benchmark. GameStop, Metaplanet, and others may follow. But the broader takeaway is this: in a competitive, inflationary world, companies that fail to evolve risk irrelevance. Bitcoin offers a path forward—one rooted in long-term thinking and strategic capital deployment.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations. This article is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation to acquire, purchase, or subscribe for securities.\n\nTags: Bill Miller IV, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, gamestop, michael saylor, Strategy\n",

The Breez SDK was initially developed to simplify the process of integrating Lightning Network support into different consumer applications. Dozens of existing projects and companies currently build on Lightning using the SDK.\n\nThe SDK supports two methods of Lightning integration. Native, which allows app developers to integrate a Lightning wallet or functionality utilizing the Greenlight service offered by Blockstream, which allows the wallet provider to host a cloud based Lightning node for users while keeping private keys solely in the users control, and Nodeless, which allows Liquid support to seamlessly integrate with the Lightning Network. Both models supported in the SDK give full support to the range of features available on the Lightning Network, as well as Liquid, without the complexity of having to build support from scratch.\n\nMisty Breez is built on the Nodeless SDK tooling. This means that users’ coins are self-custodied on the Liquid sidechain, giving users the ability to fully control their own funds but also requiring the trust trade-offs involved in using the Liquid Network (i.e. that the majority Federation signers will remain honest and trustworthy).\n\nThe wallet supports BOLT 11 and BOLT 12 invoices, LNURL-Pay, Lightning Addresses, on-chain BTC addresses, and even Matt Corrallo’s BIP 353 using DNS to fetch payment details for another user’s wallet. It also supports offline payments based on mobile notifications in the phone’s operating system.\n\nBreez SDK’s goal is to provide developers with the tooling to build a seamless and use-case specific user experience with as little effort as possible. In that vein Misty Breez aims to set a benchmark for a simplified user experience that other developers can use as a reference for Lightning integration into their own applications, or even to build on top of Misty Breez itself. If you want, feel free to simply integrate the functionality you seek to build into Misty Breez itself and rebrand it however you want (it is 100% opensource).\n\nDocumentation for the Breez SDK Nodeless configuration used by Misty Breez is available here. The Github for the Misty Breez implementation is available here. Lastly, for users who wish to play around with the application, early access release is available here for Android, and here for iOS.\n\nA direct APK download is available here.\n\nAll the tooling for developers to build a new UX experience for users is here today.\n\nTags: Breez, Breez SDK, Misty Breez\n",

    "full_content": "# No Password Reset? How Frostr Saves Your Nostr Identity\n\nAuthor: Juan Galt | Date: April 2, 2025\n\nCategories: BUSINESS, FEATURED\n\nBorn out of a hackathon at TABCONF 2024, Frostr may have just solved Nostr’s most pernicious issue: the inability to reset your password if your private key gets compromised.Started in October of 2024, Frostr just announced the alpha release of Igloo and Frost2x, a desktop and accompanying browser extension key signers for the Nostr ecosystem.\n\nThe project was founded by Topher (cmdruid) who made his name as a Bitcoin engineer for developing Tapscript — a popular library for managing Taproot, Schnorr signatures, and Bitcoin transactions — and Austin (bitcoinplebdev) a Lightning developer for Voltage and founder of PlebDevs, a Lightning-powered developer education platform with over 500 enrolled students.\n\nWhile resetting a password may seem innocuous or like a simple UI feature, it’s not that easy. Let me take you on a journey of the complexity of the issue it solves and the magnitude of what is at stake if we fail to solve this apparently simple problem.\n\n### The Social Media Revolution\n\nSocial media has changed the world. And yet, we find ourselves in a strange place with our digital identities. Who we are online and how we assert ownership of our online profiles often depends on trusted third parties like Facebook that are too big to care about any individual customer and fundamentally have the power to change the rules at any time, or even cancel your account altogether.The deplatforming of controversial influencers and even politicians in recent years serve as examples of how this centralized power can be wielded. Perhaps the best-known illustration of this is the removal of U.S. President Donald Trump from both Facebook and Twitter shortly after the January 6 riots at the U.S. capitol, just days before the end of his first term.\n\nStill, much of the world continues to operate on this digital neo-feudalism structure. It seems there’s a fundamental problem with the “decentralization” of identity that is yet to be solved.\n\n### Modern-Day Bank Robbery\n\nIdentity systems are a critical layer of society. Whether you are a citizen of Rome 2,000 years ago or of the United States today, doors open and close based on what ID you hold. Today’s systems, as advanced as they may seem, rely on a pre-digital conception of identity and security: They depend on authenticating your face.The ID card itself, whether your driver’s license or passport, helps government employees, bank tellers and bar bouncers all over the world do a very simple thing: Decide if you look like the person on the official card, and then sort out if you are allowed access or not.But the world is changing fast. Neither the obscurity of your physical appearance nor the secret nature of your social security number (SSN) are what they were in the pre-internet world: Many people have published their full names and pictures to Facebook, and a series of hacks have leaked tons of SSN data to the dark web. (For example, the Equifax Data Breach in 2017, which affected 147.9 million Americans, or the National Public Data Breach of 2024 with over 200 million Americans compromised.)In the analog, pre-internet days, when a robber burst through the doors of their local bank, they would do so to take the cash, gold and tradable valuables stored in the vaults.But that’s no longer how things work. In the digital age, money is no longer cash. Fiat payments are often reversible, so if you hack into a bank and move money to your account somehow, not only can that be reversed, but you just exposed a link to your identity.Today, the online equivalent of a robber is not looking to steal cash, gold or other valuables, but rather, personal identity data.\n\nThat data can, in turn, be used to defraud those same banks, as well as businesses of all sizes.Indeed, identity fraud costs more than all other forms of theft combined, totaling over $56 billion in 2020.\n\nNot only have many of these centralized platforms had their data vaults hacked and their contents sold on the dark web for pennies on the dollar, but AI is improving quickly and has already passed the Turing test of image generation. We are at a point where rogue actors can create fake selfies holding fake IDs with leaked user data and fool the gatekeepers to your digital wealth.This threat is likely to incentivize change, and you can see the new efforts by tech companies and government institutions to upgrade identity systems. Take California’s mobile driver’s license app as an example, mDL — developed in partnership with both Google and Apple — is initially integrated with airports for identity verification. But the app also invites developers to integrate it as a form of authentication for websites in general. ID.me takes a similar approach and is already fully integrated with the IRS, boasting 136 million members.\n\nMany of these apps require face or fingerprint authentication, and ask for increasingly complex KYC selfies from their users who must hold up IDs and recent newspapers to be authenticated.\n\nDespite the obvious weakness of using your face to authenticate your identity in the age of Facebook, tech giants continue to rely on biometric data, combining it with mass surveillance tools seen in the social credit score systems being built up in China.\n\nTo have a chance at curbing what seems like fate in the digital age, before it comes to the West, we need an identity authentication system that is both secure and agnostic to biometric data. We need an identity system that does not rely on our face.\n\n### Enter Nostr, a Bitcoin-Era Identity and Social Media Protocol\n\nBorn out of the Bitcoin developer ecosystem, Nostr has quickly grown into a social media network in its own right.An abbreviation of “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” — a bit of a mouthful — Nostr empowers users to authenticate themselves into social media pseudonyms (nyms) and sign their posts with a Bitcoin-style private key. As a self-custody system that fundamentally democratizes the internet away from its current structure, it opens up a whole new set of possibilities for social media.Proponents of Nostr argue that users can finally own their own data and no longer need to depend on the charity or benevolence of the Silicon Valley giants when they decide to move platforms or pick the wrong political party.Nostr works via a distributed client-server network topology, which allows you to access content across various servers called relays. If one goes down or starts censoring users unfairly, chances are there’s another window into the Nostr content feed that will grant you access and allow you to publish your thoughts.\n\nThe dream of Nostr is to unlock a new generation of social media technology that does not turn users into products by mining their data, that does not force biometric authentication, compromising their privacy, and that allows developers to build in an open network whose cryptography and specs are already open source and which is natively integrated with Bitcoin, the internet’s money.\n\nCelebrities and users who wish to protect their Nostr brands from fake accounts trying to impersonate them can follow a standard similar to the one developed by Keybase, which asked users to publicly attest to their a keybase identity with their other social media accounts, consolidating markers of reputation into one cryptographically controlled identity. Though that is not currently a practice in Nostr, it is a problem reasonably well solved in a decentralized way by Keybase.\n\nHowever, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Pushing identity ownership to the edges comes with a whole new set of problems that up until now have not really been solved and which have personally held me back from investing in building up my brand on Nostr.\n\n### No Password Resets\n\nThere’s currently no real way to reset your password for a Nostr nym or identity. Built on a simple public key pair system, if your private key gets hacked or leaked, your identity is essentially now under the control of whoever got it. (You both have the secret, so no one has exclusive control of it.)This is a huge issue. Although the examples of such hacks are not too common, they are a significant deterrent for brands that might consider putting serious capital into building on this new social network protocol.This particular risk is made worse by the intended design of Nostr, which invites many different interfaces to be created to access content of various kinds with the same user identities and means that users give their private keys to multiple clients, thus multiplying the risk of compromise.One layer of defense that has been built up and become popular as a result is the idea of an external signer, often a browser extension like Alby that helps manage your private key as a kind of password manager, facilitating signing of content for you on the various Nostr platforms.While this works well enough today it doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. One mistake and the nym is effectively compromised, the value of that built-up brand or reputation not just harmed but potentially exploitable by scammers wearing your identity to harass your friends or customers.This is similar to the very common impersonation scams on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which clone your profile and DM your known associates with phishing schemes, but even worse. In Nostr such an attack would be done with your identity — not a fake profile — significantly harming confidence in the authenticity of all content for those who are aware of the issue.\n\nThe solution should be simple: just create a password reset feature. Right?Well, it turns out some very creative engineering is needed here, because password resets are basically only possible by giving up your control over your identity to a third party who can update a central database and give you a new key set.Until now, that is. Let’s dive into Frostr.\n\n### Frost a Breakthrough in Sovereign Key Management\n\nRecent breakthroughs in cryptography have opened new doors for self custody in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry. One specific innovation that is quickly entering the market is Frost, a Schnorr-based key management and key rotation scheme that achieves similar functionality as Bitcoin multi-signature addresses and transactions, but without the on-chain transactions costs or privacy trade-offs.\n\nSchnorr is a form of cryptography invented in the 1990s. A few years after the expiration of its European and U.S. patents, Schnorr started being discussed as a possible future upgrade to Bitcoin, and was ultimately introduced in the Taproot soft fork upgrade of 2020.\n\nThat same year Chelsea Komlo and Ian Goldberg published “FROST: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures”, a technical spec that set the foundation for its use in the Lightning Network infrastructure as well as new multi-signature schemes for self custody known as FROST.While the cryptography is complex and explaining it beyond the scope of this article, it resembles schemes like Shamir’s secret sharing. The cryptographic principles involved allow users to create a 24-word seed with Trezor’s hardware wallet, split up into three shares of 12 words each. Any two shares combined can be assembled into the master private key of the wallet, while any one share alone is insufficient to compromise or recover access to the account.\n\nHere’s a two-minute video explanation of FROST by Andrew Poelstra, Head of Research at Blockstream:\n\nThis same principle is used in FROST, a scheme which is designed to enable multi-party, multi-signature wallets, like those used by exchanges, potentially replacing multi-signature Bitcoin scripts, benefiting users with more privacy and lower costs.Frostr extends FROST by integrating it with Nostr’s relay protocol — hence the added “r” in the name. It also adapts the technology to single-user wallets, rather than industrial-grade, multi-user schemes, allowing simpler setups and unlocking key rotation (password resets) for individual users with single key pairs, like those used in Nostr.\n\nFrostr enables three new features in particular:\n\n- Threshold key signing, so that if one key gets compromised, it can be rotated out, and a fresh set of sub keys are generated, which generate the Nostr private keypair. No need to change your Nostr public and private keys (nsec). Similar to — for example — a 2-of-3 multisignature Bitcoin wallet, where if one key is lost or compromised, the other two can be used to move the coins to a new stable structure, and regain control of three fresh keys, but off-chain. It’s a magical thing.\n- No need for application-layer solutions to Nostr key rotation, only the key signers like Alby would have to integrate Frostr; Nostr apps like Primal or Damus would not even know that Frostr is being used for key rotation by its users.\n- Users who already have Nostr accounts, whose nsecs have not been compromised, do not need to migrate to new keypairs and identities but simply remove their nsecs from current key signers and start using Frostr as a more secure key management system instead.\n\nThe result? A major piece of the decentralized social media puzzle is unlocked: Trustless identities with password resets that do not depend on centralized gatekeepers for authentication.\n\nThe consequences of this innovation, if fruitful, are fundamental. The Nostr ecosystem would be wise to take a look at Frostr; it might just be enough of a security and UI improvement that a whole new generation of non-biometric, trustless digital identities, and sovereign data ownership use cases are unlocked for the Bitcoin age.For a deeper dive into Frostr, check out their website at Frostr.org or have a look at this podcast I recorded with Topher and Austin on the topic. https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/bitcoin-magazine-po/episodes/FROSTR-Explained-A-Gamechanger-for-NOSTR-Identity-Management–The-Juan-Galt-Show-e30op20\n\nTags: digital identity, FROST, Nostr, Schnorr, Surveillance\n",

But what makes this listing significant isn’t the transaction mechanics—it’s the capital strategy behind it.\n\n## BITCOIN BUILT INTO THE BALANCE SHEET\n\nSince 2023, The Smarter Web Company has accepted Bitcoin as payment. Now, as it prepares to list its shares, it’s laying the groundwork for a formal Digital Assets Treasury Policy—one that includes holding Bitcoin alongside cash.\n\nThe company’s leadership views Bitcoin not as a speculative play, but as a deliberate reserve asset. It is, in their words, a hedge against inflation and a forward-looking mechanism to preserve value over time.\n\nAs the company pursues both organic growth and strategic acquisitions post-listing, Bitcoin will serve as part of its long-term capital preservation toolkit—a move echoing the playbooks of early movers like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet.\n\n## BACKED BY BITCOIN-NATIVE CAPITAL\n\nThe company’s plans have already attracted aligned investors. In January 2025, The Smarter Web Company closed a pre-IPO funding round of more than £1 million, backed by UTXO Management—a Bitcoin-focused investment manager and operator of the hedge fund 210k Capital, LP.\n\nAn additional raise of over £2 million is underway as part of the company’s listing strategy.\n\nThis isn’t passive capital. UTXO and other mission-aligned backers are building a new class of public company—firms with long-term Bitcoin alignment and treasury discipline integrated from the start.\n\n## WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CORPORATE LEADERS\n\nOnce listed, The Smarter Web Company will become one of the first UK-listed businesses to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy from day one. That alone makes it notable. Most publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin did so as a pivot or response to broader macro shifts. Smarter Web is taking a different route—baking Bitcoin into its financial DNA before it ever hits the public markets.\n\nThis signals something much larger than a single company’s conviction. It shows that the Bitcoin treasury model is becoming accessible, practical, and strategically relevant for companies beyond the usual early adopters. You don’t need a multibillion-dollar balance sheet to begin integrating Bitcoin into your corporate strategy—you need alignment, vision, and a framework that prioritizes capital preservation and long-term value.\n\nFor mid-sized and growth-stage businesses, Bitcoin increasingly fits the bill. The same financial pressures that push large enterprises toward more efficient capital strategies—persistent inflation, fiat depreciation, and the opportunity cost of holding idle cash—apply equally, if not more urgently, to smaller firms operating in competitive environments.\n\nWhether it’s recurring revenue or future M&A, capital efficiency is a strategic imperative. Bitcoin offers a unique tool in that mix—one that traditional treasury assets cannot replicate. It’s portable, non-sovereign, resistant to dilution, and optimized for long time horizons. For companies seeking to store the value they’ve earned today and deploy it tomorrow without losing purchasing power, Bitcoin represents a new operating standard—not just a hedge.\n\n## THE PATH FORWARD\n\nAs public company disclosures begin post-listing, The Smarter Web Company has committed to including material treasury updates alongside core business performance—a level of transparency that will give investors and analysts insight into how digital assets play a role in managing corporate capital.\n\nBitcoin-native capital formation, treasury strategy, and operational adoption are no longer isolated to headline-making firms like Strategy and Metaplanet. The playbook is expanding, and companies like The Smarter Web Company are positioning themselves to lead a new chapter—where treasury innovation is a signal, not a stunt.\n\nFor corporate leaders, the lesson is clear: the barriers to action are falling. The only question that remains is timing.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations. This article is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation to acquire, purchase, or subscribe for securities. For full transparency, please note that UTXO Management, a subsidiary of BTC Inc., holds a stake in Smarter Web Company.\n\nTags: bitcoin treasury, bitcoin treasury company, Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, Corporate Bitcoin Strategy, smarter web company, UTXO Management\n",

Ron Reynolds and Mihaela Plesa.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, Texas’ comptroller would have the power to invest funds (up to $250 million, as mentioned) from the state’s Economic Stabilization Fund — colloquially referred to as the state’s “Rainy Day Fund”, which was created to serve as a savings account for the state and to prevent sudden notable cuts to schools, health care, or other vital state services — into bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt also authorizes municipalities or counties to invest up to $10 million of its funds or funds under its control into bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf the bill were to become law, it would take effect on September 1, 2025, which would provide state- and local-level government officials time to formulate an investment strategy as well as devise a plan for custody.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Laws, H.B. 4258 is one of eight currently active bitcoin- or crypto-related bills that have been introduced to either the Texas Senator or the state’s House of Representatives. Of the eight bills, it’s the fifth to move to committee.\n\nFour of these bills, including this current bill, would authorize the state to put bitcoin on its balance sheet in some fashion. The other three — H.B. 1598, Senate Bill (S.B.) 21 and S.B. 778 — all call for Texas to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR).\n\nThese three SBR bills are all in committee, with S.B. 21 now in its second round of review by committee. The bill recently passed the state Senate with a 25-5 vote.\n\nTexas remains the state with the second highest number of active bitcoin- and crypto-related bills, trailing behind only Arizona, which has nine active bills, three of which are close to being enacted into law.\n\nThe state continues to be one of the most Bitcoin-friendly states in the United States, as not only is it friendly to Bitcoin in a legislative sense, but it is currently home to approximately one-third of the U.S.’s total Bitcoin mining hash rate.\n\nTags: Legislation, Politics, Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Texas, Texas Bitcoin\n",

    "full_content": "# China’s Legalization of Bitcoin Mining Threatens Global Hashrate Distribution\n\nWill China re-legalize Bitcoin mining and completely upset global hashrate distribution?\n\nAuthor: Richard Greaser | Date: April 1, 2025\n\nCategories: NEWS, SPONSORED\n\nChina’s Communist Party announced today in a surprise move that it would be reversing its stance on Bitcoin mining, legalizing mining for Chinese entities and individuals. In 2021, the Chinese government banned Bitcoin mining, citing risks of capital flight, environmental challenges, and competition to their nation’s digital currencies.\n\nThe announcement came during growing tensions between the United States government and the world’s largest Bitcoin miner manufacturer, Chinese based Bitmain. Allegedly, Bitmain skirted US sanctions on providing companies such as Huawei with AI chips. Latley, US based Bitcoin miners have been facing seizures by customs of Bitmain miners without much explanation, as reported on by Blockspace.\n\nThe move comes at a time when mining profitability is squeezing many US based mining firms. Before the Chinese mining ban, some speculated that China housed up to 75% of the global Bitcoin hashrate. Some speculate that it still has up to 20% of the global hashrate despite the ban. China’s Re-legalization of Bitcoin mining poses the possibility of an explosion in network hashrate, threatening the viability of many American firms.\n\nToday China dominates global Bitcoin miner manufacturing with the three largest manufacturers: Bitmain, Micro BT, and Canaan, based in the communist nation. With rising tensions in trade wars, combined with the legalization of Chinese mining, many are fearful that China will restrict exports of Bitcoin mining machines to the west, meaning that the United States would be at a serious disadvantage. Luxor estimates that the United States currently has roughly 36% of the world’s hashrate with 17% of it estimated to be located in Texas.\n\nChina has been facing many economic headwinds due to the fall out of their restrictive Covid- 19 response, the deflation of their real estate bubble and the general global economic downturn and may be looking at Bitcoin as a way to help jump start their faltering economy.\n\nMany are speculating whether this move may mean that China will be changing its tune in regards to Bitcoin in general, seeking to try and outpace the United States in stockpiling the digital currency.\n\nIf the Chinese government were to restrict exports of Chinese made Bitcoin miners, it could put the United States years behind the land of the dragon. While TSMC (The world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors) has been building chip manufacturing plants in the United States, it will likely take some time for the other manufacturers based in the US to catch up with Bitmain, leading to a likely dominance of Bitcoin network hashrate by China.\n\nThere are some hopes though for preventing complete network centralization. “TSMC, based in Taiwan, could stop providing ASIC chips to Chinese manufacturers,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot Platforms. “This would hurt Bitcoin’s decentralization and could escalate tensions with China.” he explained. In recent yrars, China has been floating the idea of invading Taiwan. If China were to invade the island nation, that would only raise tensions with the west who has been on and off on whether they would provide military protections to Taiwan in the case of military conflict.\n\nChinese premier Xi Xinping has reportedly been meeting with Kim Jong Un in recent months, learning about the North Korean Bitcoin strategy.\n\nThis is a guest post by Bitcoin Bugle.

    "full_content": "# Leaked Pete Hegseth Group Chat Messages Suggest Trump Considering Nationalizing Michael Saylor’s Company Strategy\n\nIs Donald Trump planning to nationalize Strategy in a plan to bolster the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve?\n\nAuthor: Richard Greaser | Date: April 1, 2025\n\nCategories: NEWS, SPONSORED\n\nOn Monday, the Atlantic released a series of unredacted messages from a Signal chat including various Trump administration officials discussing the administration’s desire to nationalize Strategy (formally Microstrategy) as a way to bolster the United States Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in a “budget neutral” manner.\n\nBelow are the text messages that Hegseth sent to the group of 18 senior Trump officials on March 31, according to screenshots released by The Atlantic on Monday.\n\n- TEAM UPDATE:\n- 1000et: Strategy has been amassing Bitcoin for us. Saylor is prepared to run damage control from potential fallout.\n- 1030et: Not sure how this move will negatively impact the price of the president’s Solana Meme Coin.\n- 1045: Discussing strategies with social media influencers to spin narrative away from this being an executive order 6102 like event.\n- 1055: President is concerned David Bailey will uninvite him from the Bitcoin conference if he makes this move.\n- 1100: Jason Lowery advises to do it. Says it plays perfectly into his Softwar thesis.\n- 1130: Brian Armstrong is also asking for Coinbase to be nationalized as well. It seems like he gets off on complying however he can.\n- 1145: POTUS is advising to hold off until more research can be done on potential implications to his meme coin prices. MORE TO FOLLOW. We are currently clean on OPSEC. Godspeed to our crypto bags.\n\nThe messages were leaked to the Atlantic by an unnamed PODCONF official who was mistakenly added to the group chat and is concerned the events could undermine Bitcoin’s “Number Go Up.”\n\nWhy defense secretary Pete Hegseth is involved: Bitcoin seems to be a growing part of the Trump Administration’s national security policy. Financial sovereignty is a substantial part of national defense. Some speculate that Donald Trump is very proud of the way that Hegseth handled the bombing of Yemen last week.\n\nWhy it matters: Many Bitcoin users have been critical of Strategy, due to its close proximity to Langley, VA as well its choice to custody funds with Coinbase, who also custody funds for  the United States government. The leaked Signal group chat log suggests that Strategy may have been operating as a front for the US government to amass a large portion of Bitcoin. A common saying in the Bitcoin community is “Not your keys, not your coins,” pointing to how the digital currency could be arbitrarily confiscated by governments if held by 3rd parties.\n\nWhat Hegseth is saying: It appears Hegseth understands this will likely be an unpopular move both in the business world and the Bitcoin ecosystem. When a government nationalizes a company in order to take control of their assets, it can cause uncertainty in the business world. It seems that the Trump administration is working with a series of media personalities and influencers to try and craft a narrative in an effort to manage any tensions or fallout that could result from this move.\n\nHow this could impact Bitcoin Price: Analysts we have talked with are ambivalent on  how the nationalization of Strategy could impact the price of Bitcoin. In the short term it may cause fear and uncertainty leading to a sell off, but many believe that it’s good for price in the long term as once again, it would be a vote of confidence in the digital currency from the world’s most powerful government.\n\nWill this leak unwind the plan: The leak may have foiled the Trump Administration’s plans, yet it is unsure if they were  planning on doing this versus just exploring the possibility. In 1962 the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented a plan to President Kennedy called Operation Northwoods in which acts of terrorism carried out by US intelligence agencies would be committed on US soil in an attempt to manufacture consent for the invasion of Cuba. From Hegseth’s messages, the president appeared hesitant as the move may have negative impacts on the price of his cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nThis story is continuing to break. Please check back for more updates as the story continues to develop.\n\nThis is a guest post by Bitcoin Bugle.

Bitcoin Bugle’s annual popularity tournament took a strange turn when 16 seed wildcard Teddy Bitcoins defeated Bitcoin fan favorite, Adam Back.\n\nDuring the seven rounds of polling, Bitcoin maximalists followed in horror as Twitter villain and rumored felon Teddy Bitcoin overtook the prestigious news agency’s race with a wild voter turnout that put to shame Biden’s 2020 successful US elections sweep.\n\nIn the PODCONF sponsored showdown, Teddy Bitcoin beat legendary Bitcoin maximalists including Greg Zaj, Hodl Magoo, Adam Back, the lovely Lyn Alden and defending champion Yellow, concluding the ‘Maxi’ championship by defeating Strategy CEO Michael Saylor by a large margin.The final poll drew over 90 thousand votes, a record in the championship’s history.\n\nAt first drawing enthusiasm and sportsmanship, the tournament took a dark turn after Teddy beat championed memer Yellow in the 4rd round. The social media platform increasingly roared with ‘rees’ and accusations as Bitcoin purists searched for who to blame. Online commentators accused PODCONF, the auditor of the contest, with corruption and mismanagement. Many of these conspiracy theorists spread unsubstantiated claims on the fairness of the voting system.\n\nSwanning to the Rescue\n\nSwan Bitcoin, a Bitcoin brokerage service with strong brand recognition thanks to its ‘Bitcoin Maxi’ identity politics, had many employees upset by these events. Swan’s C Suite was seen protesting Teddy Bitcoin in numerous online posts, calling him a scammer, before simmering down during the alleged mental health day.\n\nText for image: Swan co-founder tweeted in support of inventor of proof-of-work Adam Beck competing agiainst his fellow $MSTR enthusiets Teddy Bitcoin\n\nAshley Marchetta, Swan’s head of Culture and People answered our request for comment: “Identity is central not only to Swan Bitcoin’s marketing and sales strategy but to our culture as a Bitcoin company. Teddy Bitcoin’s win in Maxi Madness was a clear attack on our business’ and customer’s core identity. Being a Bitcoin Maxi isn’t just about being ‘Bitcoin only’ but about ambition and keeping things clean. In our team’s view, The Bugle has slandered Bitcoin Maximalism by letting shitcoiners like Jason Williams and Teddy Bitcoins into this prestigious Maxi only tournament. These outcomes created immense mental damage to our community. We know this has been tough on the ecosystem, and are now providing community crisis counseling.”  Marchetta added that they would be tasking Swan’s HR department with offering their counseling services to the broader community to help reaffirm their identities as Bitcoin maxis.\n\nIs this good use of the firm’s resources? Many expect this move will help gain favor for Swan in the Bitcoin community which has seen a rise of Antiswanitism over the last year.\n\nIf you’re feeling distressed following Maxi Madness, please email: crisissupport@swanbitcoin.com.\n\nThis is a guest post by Bitcoin Bugle.

    "full_content": "# Beyond The Vault: Why Bitcoin’s True Power Lies In Motion\n\nA critique of Saylor’s store of value obsession and a case for the medium of exchange, and a case for why Bitcoin needs to be both.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Makedonski | Date: April 1, 2025\n\nCategories: CULTURE, FEATURED\n\nMichael Saylor, you were forced to realise that all the store-of-value assets are defective and pushed you to focus on the only asset that is not. That does not make you immune to seeing the medium of exchange case. You will see how the housing market is huge when you watch it from one point of view and horrible from another. But if you experience pain driving you to keep your billions of dollars purchasing power, housing is a decent tool to keep it.\n\nYour SoV obsession misses the mark—badly. The biggest aspect of Bitcoin is the medium of exchange. Even though the fiat system increasingly separates money’s functions, that doesn’t mean it should. I get that saying Bitcoin is a medium of exchange is kicking the hornet’s nest, and all the other currency lords will try to stop Bitcoin. It’d be great if they joined in instead of fighting it. That will give all the billionaires certainty that they can put money in it, but simply using Bitcoin just to store value is attacking it. That approach will turn it into digital gold 2.0, captured.\n\nThere’s no store of value without a medium of exchange! The medium of exchange comes first. You receive a transaction, then you store the Bitcoin. If the store of value were the main point, imagine announcing you lost your keys for your Bitcoin stack—you’d still store it perfectly, but without the medium of exchange function, the market will wipe out the fictional fiat value layered on top. That value is there exactly because it can move and still can be used as a medium of exchange.\n\nAn oxygen tank is vital for reserves, but breathing matters more. The store of value is secondary and relies on the ability to transact. Without that, the store of value means nothing. Michael, you learned this firsthand when your million-dollar holdings in Argentina were diluted by 90%. You struggled to preserve the value not because you did not see it coming but because you couldn’t use it as a medium of exchange. True, a poor store of value weakens the medium of exchange, but why does the latter take priority? Because the ability to exchange is what lets you respond.\n\nBy now, most people exposed to Bitcoin know the chart from Jesse Mayers that you popularized. You claim there’s no better idea than a $900 trillion clean store of value, then immediately call Bitcoin one of the world’s most liquid markets, running 24/7/365. Guess what? Liquidity means medium of exchange.\n\nNow, let’s break down the Jesse chart, starting with the housing market. It’s valued at $330 trillion, but it’s such a poor medium of exchange that it only trades for $1.3 trillion annually. Regulations and taxes make trading real estate even tougher. Still, since it’s more than 100 times better as a store of value, billionaires prize it, increasingly dominating the market and pricing out younger generations.\n\nA house might be valuable, but its worth grows not just from what it is but from its ties to nearby utilities. Build a road to it, and the value rises. Add a superstore or a gas station, or connect it to the electrical grid, and the value climbs again. The network creates opportunities for energy to flow into the area, boosting the chance to capture that energy as economic value, like money. So the exchanges that happen in the network are what increases the value of a house. But I see the flip side: if you’re a billionaire and everyone’s after your resources, you don’t want a big network around your house. You’d prioritize privacy instead. The house might lose value, but the goal shifts to raising the cost for others to reach you, reducing the chance to be attacked.\n\nWhat about the bond market? Bonds are valued at $300 trillion as a store of value, with $140 trillion traded yearly plus $25 trillion in new bond issuance. That means the medium of exchange value is about 50% of its total value annually. It’s better than houses in that sense, but the numbers still show people primarily use it as a store of value.\n\nNext up are equities. Valued at $115 trillion, they were traded for about $175 trillion. This shows their strength as a medium of exchange exceeds their store of value role. Take your MicroStrategy stock—you know it better than anyone. How much value did it store last year, and how much was exchanged through it?\n\nThe next two sections are interesting. The art industry’s yearly transactions are so minor that they don’t even register on the chart. Meanwhile, the cars and collectibles sector sees trading volumes of nearly $4 trillion annually. This highlights that they’re mostly seen as a store of value each year, but it also reveals how poorly the housing market performs as a medium of exchange—outdone even by the car market.\n\nOoooh gold! Gold bugs rave that it’s been around for over 5,000 years, calling it the ultimate store of value for whatever reason—yet it’s just 1.78% of the store of value market. This shows that once its medium of exchange role was stripped away, it became vulnerable to capture and manipulation. Sorry, gold bugs, that genie’s not going back in the lamp. Gold holds $16 trillion in value, and the gold bugs claim it could store the $120 trillion worth of money in it. They’re desperate to pump their bags, but the market disagrees, valuing the defective fiat money ten times higher than the shiny, lifeless rock. Is gold a better medium of exchange, then? It trades at $54 trillion yearly, boosted by derivatives, making its medium of exchange use 3.5 times its store of value role.\n\nMoney might not dominate as a store of value among assets, but it’s the leading medium of exchange by far. Other stores of value assets don’t even come close. What if the dollar, the top currency, became just a store of value? It would collapse the USD network, boosting the value of non-US assets as their networks step in to meet the demand. Over time, their store of value assets would rise while USD assets would plummet. Global money totals around $120 trillion, but look at the top central banks’ transaction volumes: Fedwire at ~$1,182 trillion, TARGET2 at ~$765 trillion, CHAPS at ~$145 trillion, and others (partial) at ~$500 trillion (a conservative estimate due to incomplete data). So, while the store of value is $120 trillion—per the Jesse chart—the medium of exchange utility of these networks is over 20 times greater, which is around ~$2.5 quadrillion. What would the medium of exchange value be if 2 billion unbanked people were included? How many more transactions would that spark? And what if microtransactions were possible?\n\nWhere does Bitcoin fit into all of this? The prevailing narrative urges holders never to sell, positioning Bitcoin solely as a store of value. Yet, the market tells a different story. In 2024, Bitcoin’s market cap hit $2 trillion, while the value exchanged on its first layer—the blockchain—reached $3.4 trillion. Factor in the Lightning Network (though its exact figures remain elusive), and the total likely approaches $4 trillion. This suggests that Bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange is twice as significant as its store-of-value function. So, what happens if that long-standing “hold forever” propaganda narrative begins to fade?\n\nBonds and equities are financial “instruments” that pretend to be money because fiat currency is flawed. This creates a market that shuts out much of the population from safeguarding their wealth, further splitting money’s store of value role. But how inclusive are these instruments? Or are they just tools to siphon value from the fiat medium of exchange, channeling it to privileged individuals and billionaires and others alike with a need to hoard?\n\nGlobally, only 10-20% of people have exposure to bonds, mostly indirectly through pension or investment funds, not directly. For equities, 15-25% of the population has some access. That leaves at best 80% of humanity without these tools to protect themselves, making them vulnerable to exploitation. Splitting the store of value from the medium of exchange sets up a dynamic of extractors and the extracted. This amplifies the “cantillion effect”: those who can print the medium of exchange buy up store-of-value assets, sidelining 80% or more of people. It’s a feedback loop that weakens the system, widening the gap between haves and have-nots. The more you print, the more you disconnect money from its store-of-value role.\n\nAnother very big part of the whole system is the fees. There are fees for sending dollars via the banking system, and that is a service, but how much are the fees when you want to switch from the medium of exchange into the store-of-value instruments? A lot more. That is creating so much friction in the whole system, and it contributes to excluding the have-nots from storing their value. At this point, the medium of exchange turns more and more into the medium of extraction rather than for exchange. This is also a reason why the store of value case is more appealing in the fiat system.\n\nBitcoin is not pretending to be money like everything else; it is the first engineered money that doesn’t erode like a melting ice cube and doesn’t discriminate. It is the money of those who choose it. With no printer behind it, there’s no urge to swap it for a “better” store of value—there’s no second best. Even those without Bitcoin can use it to shape their lives into the lives they desire. Moving away from chasing money to store in something and instead building whatever enriches their lives on top of Bitcoin.\n\nThe biggest idea isn’t storing value—it’s moving it. But to move value, you first need to have some stored. Then again, to have some stored, someone needs to move some your way first. That’s why the rich prefer assets that don’t erode like a melting ice cube. Meanwhile, those starting their careers focus more on receiving value than storing what they don’t yet have.\n\nWhy does the store of value case draw so much attention? One reason could be the effort involved. With a store of value, you buy and hodl—no work needed to improve your life. With a medium of exchange, you must work to grow your savings, persuading others to pay for your goods or services in Bitcoin. Another factor: for most, their fiat portfolio still outweighs their Bitcoin one. Only when Bitcoin surpasses their fiat holdings will they consider enhancing their lives with it. That shift isn’t tough for much of the world’s population, who lack savings or assets anyway. This might explain why the current system resists letting them exit, pushing dependency by offering to custody their Bitcoin—trading one reliance for another.\n\nEven ossification ties into the need for more mediums of exchange use. You, Michael, strongly support ossification, but if Bitcoin isn’t used to reach more people, you’re delaying it. Unlike you, America knew that to make the dollar the world’s reserve currency, they had to distribute it widely to lock in the network effect. They saw the network as the key to ossification, and it worked easily since printing and sharing bills cost little. With Bitcoin, its absolute scarcity requires balancing how much to spread versus store. Still, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend any at all.\n\nThe metaphor of storing fat in the body is key to long-term survival. True, but it overlooks the need for a steady food income to stay alive before storing fat. Without income, there’s nothing to store—so exchange comes first. Yet, for someone not worried about hunger, the focus shifts to storing food to prevent spoilage. I keep hammering this point to highlight your bias toward the store of value, which skews your judgment and misleads others.\n\nAt this stage of my Bitcoin journey, I’m certain of this: chasing money corrupts you. Bitcoin shifts that—it stops you from pursuing money endlessly and lets you use it for the life you want. What happens when you have enough of everything you desire? What then? With Bitcoin, that’s entirely possible, and every Bitcoiner should be ready with an answer for when it happens. Chasing money, though, is a bottomless pit you can’t fill. The Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil. I agree, but how does it play out? What is the mechanism? Chasing money—making it the top priority and making the other things lesser—is the mechanism.\n\nYou’re not building a Bitcoin standard—you’re stacking a deck. Like gold in the past, you’re the one this time hoarding Bitcoin from people and institutions, further entrenching the fiat standard. Saylor, you’re not attacking the dollar as some believe—you’re bolstering it by boosting your stock and its ecosystem. Instead, you’re speculatively hitting those who fund your Bitcoin buys. You’re not just hurting them; by strengthening the dollar, you’re amplifying the pain for other currency holders. Hoarding sats while the world watches? That’s not a cybercity—it’s a gated estate funded by their own money.\n\nI wonder if people would want to invest their Bitcoin in your securities. How many would actually do it? I’m sure true Bitcoin maximalists wouldn’t trade their perfect store of value asset for a fiat “instrument.” Ask yourself: at this point, would you spend your Bitcoin to buy Apple stock? You did invest in them before, after all. It makes no sense—I’d give you Bitcoin just for you to turn it into some fiat thing, pay fiat fees, bolster fiat custodians and third parties, only so you can buy Bitcoin again on the other end.\n\nIn the end, I don’t have proof, but I’m fairly certain you already know everything I’m saying in this article/message. Though it’s written to you, Michael, it’s aimed at those who see you as the new Bitcoin Jesus, blindly following without questioning your actions. They make reckless bets in their own lives—bets that could wipe out their Bitcoin—lacking the financial safeguards and interest rates you have. Your messages, which they echo, don’t apply to most of humanity.\n\nBitcoin isn’t just another asset or financial tool—it’s borderless, permissionless money for the people. Treating it otherwise diminishes its true worth. Merely storing it won’t bring freedom. Letting sats flow builds the network. Letting sats flow fosters cooperation for a better future. Letting sats flow strengthens the ecosystem. Store some for tomorrow, but do not be the richest man in the grave—save them for plans that keep them moving later.\n\nThis is a guest post by Ivan Makedonski.
