    "full_content": "# Rep. Keith Ammon Is New Hampshire’s Premier Bitcoin Advocate\n\nRep. Keith Ammon (R) is a freedom-loving member of New Hampshire’s House of Representatives — and he’s doing his damnedest to orange pill the state’s legislative body.\n\nAuthor: Frank Corva | Date: April 3, 2025\n\nCategories: POLITICS\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Keith Ammon addressed a New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee on House Bill (HB) 302, which would permit the state’s treasurer to invest in bitcoin.\n\nIn speaking to the committee, he brought up the United States’ excessive debt and made the case for the state of New Hampshire to invest in bitcoin as a means to mitigate the ravaging effects of inflation.\n\nAs I listened to his petition, I got the sense that Rep. Ammon was a dyed-in-the-wool Bitcoiner, someone inside of the system doing his best to get members of the legislature of the state he calls home to see in bitcoin what he likely saw in it many moons ago.\n\nAfter speaking with Rep. Ammon, I’ve learned that this is, in fact, the case.\n\nThe software developer and self-described “Bitcoin maxi” (who admits to also seeing some value in other blockchains and crypto projects) found Bitcoin two years after its inception and has been spreading the word about it in New Hampshire ever since.\n\nAs the founder of the New Hampshire Blockchain Council and a state representative who is the lead sponsor on the three current Bitcoin- and crypto-related bills in the state that are currently working their way through the legislative process, Rep. Ammon is perhaps the most notable Bitcoin advocate in The Granite State.\n\nAnd the story of how he found Bitcoin is bad ass to boot.\n\nBased on how you spoke at Tuesday’s committee hearing about HB302, I got the impression that you’re a long-time Bitcoiner. Is this the case?\n\nYes, and I’ll start by going way back. I heard about something called the Free State Project in 2004, and I moved up to New Hampshire to be part of that. Years later, I attended an event called Liberty Forum, which is an annual event put on by the Free State Project. In 2011, there were a bunch of anarchists that didn’t like the agenda of the forum — it was too corporate for them. So, they rented a couple of rooms at the hotel where the event was held and they had their own event, which they called the “Alt Expo”. I wandered into it and just happened to sit in the room. There were maybe six people there. They had a slide projector and they were talking about the precursor to Ripple, or XRP, which was RipplePay. It was pre-blockchain, but it was some kind of system of nodes and you would lend people money and IOUs would flow back and forth. It just didn’t click for me, though. But I kept in touch with that small group of people, and, a few months later, the idea of Bitcoin popped out of another discussion with them. I remember being like, “Wow, this is amazing. This is the thing that is going to change the world.”\n\nDid you grasp it right away?\n\nI come from a software development background, and I read books like The Creature From Jekyll Island in my early twenties, so my brain was primed to receive the concepts related to Bitcoin and the light bulb went off very early. I had a lot of understanding about big, abstract systems, which is basically what Bitcoin is. But then also the game theory behind it is just amazing. Bitcoin is like a virus that inhabits the human mind and spreads from person to person.\n\nWhat has it been like trying to spread it to other members of government?\n\nSo, fast forward to 2015 — I was elected to the state legislature. We tried proposing a few Bitcoin-related bills around that time, but nobody understood Bitcoin back then. However, I’ve kept with it, and now it’s at the point where I’m a subject matter expert within our legislature. I’m in my fifth term, and Bitcoin has become more mainstream. Other politicians in New Hampshire reach out to me whenever they hear something positive about Bitcoin. Well, they reach out with negative news, too, but lately, there’s been a lot of positive news. So, I’m finding it a little easier to bring the legislature up to speed.\n\nYou’ve done a lot of work shifting the Overton window regarding Bitcoin in New Hampshire. And, in the committee hearing on Tuesday, you talked about using bitcoin as a tool to hedge against U.S. dollar debasement. You mentioned that the U.S. federal government is $36 trillion dollars in debt and that it will have to print more money to meet its debt obligations. How do people in government react when you bring up tough truths like this and propose bitcoin as a solution?\n\nOur national debt is a very harsh reality that people often just overlook. However, there are quite a few gold bugs in our legislature, and they’re from the sound money school of thought. But the majority in the legislature, and just people in general, view the national debt like an asteroid that’s coming — we can see it coming, but we still have to get up and go to work every day. It’s a scenario where, unless you really fixate on what’s happening, you tend to not focus on it because it’s such a big problem. If it ever escalates and snowballs, it could cause massive chaos in society. We don’t want that to happen, and we can see that there is an alternative with bitcoin. You can pick up your marbles and switch teams. You don’t have to suffer the consequences. Well, you’ll be affected on some level if society starts crumbling, but you can limit some of the consequences, or at least protect your personal sovereignty and wealth. And I look at this for the state. The conversation on Tuesday was about enabling the state treasurer to invest in digital assets that have a market cap of $500 billion or more. We’re trying to get all these conversations moving within the state government so that when it becomes a little more obvious that bitcoin is a solution to inflation, or the country going bankrupt, God forbid, the state government’s members are primed to receive this message.\n\nI’m sure it’s easier to get politicians to see the problem than it is to convince them that bitcoin is a solution, though. Are you getting a lot of pushback on HB302?\n\nWith that particular bill, we worked with the Satoshi Action Fund. I’ve gotten to be buddies with Dennis Porter and Eric Peterson. We started with one of their pieces of model legislation. The first thing we did was we met with the state treasurer. Dennis and his team showed up and I had a couple of people there from the Blockchain Council. We sat in the treasurer’s office and talked with her about it. She was not 100% familiar with bitcoin, but was open to the idea of learning more about it. She also commented that her colleagues around the country are beginning to talk about digital assets. After this discussion, we refined the bill. We amended it in the Commerce Committee, which is the first committee it went through. After that, we talked to the state treasurer again about the amendments. She said that the state treasury department may not invest in bitcoin right away but that it would be nice to have another tool in the toolbox, another potential asset to invest in.\n\nHB302 stipulates that only digital assets with a market cap of over $500 billion can be included in the reserve. As of now, only bitcoin meets this criteria. How did you come up with this number and do you foresee a number of other digital assets eventually being added to the reserve?\n\nThere has to be some kind of threshold, because we don’t want anyone to get the idea that the state treasurer might invest in meme coins. However, we can’t explicitly say “bitcoin” in the legislation.\n\nWhy not?\n\nIt would be seen as picking winners and losers. Good legislation should be rational and unbiased.\n\nWhat is the likelihood that HB302 passes?\n\nWell, so it’s likely going to pass the House, and then it will go to the Senate. I think there’s a higher than 50% chance that it passes the Senate. The problem is when the House passes some bills and the Senate knows that there’s a priority on the House side, they attach their stuff to it when the bill comes over. Because of this, sometimes bills can die in that crossfire between the two chambers.\n\nAre politicians in New Hampshire’s government now taking the idea of a bitcoin or digital asset reserve more seriously because they’re seeing members of other state governments put forth bills that propose the creation of such reserves in other states?\n\nI don’t know. There are really only a handful of members of New Hampshire’s legislative body that are paying attention to this. I try to stress when I testify that the last one in the pool when it comes to bitcoin loses. In other words, we don’t want to be the last state to buy bitcoin, because its price will rise significantly in the meantime, especially if other states start buying first. There’s still some skepticism about Bitcoin. All these false narratives — like that its energy use is going to melt the planet or that it’s only used by criminals, terrorists, and drug dealers — are still pervasive. As new people try to wrap their head around it, they often default to discrediting it as quickly as possible, because, after they do that, they don’t have to think about it anymore. So, these same arguments just keep being brought up by new people who are still trying to figure it out. The same thing happens in our legislature. However, now that the Trump administration is talking seriously about it, talking about how we’re going to be a Bitcoin country, that really breaks some walls down. Now, even if they don’t fully understand it, they’ll at least take it more seriously.\n\nIf HB302 is passed and the state treasurer begins buying bitcoin, what sort of custodial setup do you imagine the state creating?\n\nEverything moves at a snail’s pace in government, so the most likely scenario is that they purchase some shares of say the Fidelity spot bitcoin ETF at first. Fidelity is like one of the largest employers in New Hampshire. That carries a lot of clout. So, I’d imagine they would invest a small amount into a vehicle like that. But as time goes on, the state’s being able to self custody bitcoin is important. I’d imagine they probably don’t want to do it on their own because they’d be afraid of losing their keys. They’d probably like an institutional shared custody situation, like what Unchained or other companies offer — custody across institutions with a multisig.\n\nOne issue that hasn’t been coming up in a lot of Bitcoin- and crypto-related legislation is crypto mixers and their legality. Plus, the Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash developers are still on trial, despite many other crypto cases being thrown out under the Trump administration. What are your thoughts on crypto mixers? Should Americans be allowed to use them?\n\nYes. Financial privacy is super important. It’s bad if you purchase a cup of coffee and the merchant that owns the shop that you spend your couple of sats at can see your entire bitcoin balance. Financial privacy is huge, and it’s something that we can’t give up. So, however that’s done, it should be protected.\n\nAny final thoughts?\n\nYeah, there’s a lot of scamminess in the crypto space, and it gets so annoying. Bitcoin is the opposite. It’s the hard truth. If you understand Bitcoin, you value the truth, you value honesty and transparency. It gets kind of old to always have to dodge these scammy bullets from the larger crypto ecosystem. The truth is going to win in the end. Many other projects in the space are just noise — a big smoke screen.\n\nTags: New Hampshire, Politicians, Politics, State Governments, Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\n",

In tribute to her father, a long-time NASA employee, this ordinals series uniquely merges satellite data and bitcoin block times, alongside seasonal and astronomical patterns such as the phases of the moon. Post Wook will showcase this work as part of both B25 and the off-site ordinals event, Inscribing Vegas.\n\nI caught up with Post Wook to discuss her latest digital art series, the future of immersive art, and the experience of seeing her work featured on the Sphere in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Las Vegas Sphere has quickly become the principal attraction on the Las Vegas Strip. What was it like to see your artwork, “Everywhere but Inward,” displayed on the Sphere for the first time?\n\nIt honestly felt very surreal! Having worked on the piece for over a year, I was super familiar with the animation sequencing, but seeing it actually on the Sphere for the first time felt so cool. The Sphere is LARGE, and you think you know that when you see photos, but then when you see it in real life it blows you away. We got to our lookout spot in Vegas about 15-20 min before it popped up in the programming, and once it actually came on it felt so wild! I think I started clapping. I never do that. I was just so happy to be in the moment.\n\nThe Sphere is one of the world’s largest and most sophisticated immersive platforms, featuring a 16K resolution interior and an exterior LED display that spans over 580,000 square feet. How does the scale of the Sphere’s surface affect the viewer’s perception of your digital artwork? You’re no stranger to fantastical landscapes or extra-perceptionary vistas, so this must have been especially interesting to take in.\n\nThe actual process of animating Everywhere but Inward, 2024 for Sphere was interesting because with a screen that big the animation had to be a lot slower than I’d normally animate. So honestly, watching the animation as an equirectangular piece on my monitor felt like watching paint dry. But watching it on Sphere, it feels like a regular animation. I guess that’s just showbiz.\n\nOn the whole I’m just excited to see digital art take center stage. With Sphere in Vegas becoming literally the talk of the strip to the new Sphere they’re building in Dubai, it’s pretty obvious that digital art is on the rise and is becoming increasingly legitimate to the world around us.\n\nThe ephemeral nature of a public display on the Sphere contrasts with the permanence and immutability of on-chain art. How do you view the tension between the grandeur of public spectacle and the private, immutable ownership of digital art? Does this shift in how art is owned and experienced influence your approach to creating and presenting your work?\n\nI sort of look at it like ‘exterior’ and ‘interior’ work with Sphere showing people that digital art is cool and on-chain art reinforces that digital art is valuable. The public spectacle brings people in and on-chain ownership provides traceable provenance. I’d like to think I balance that tension well. By having licensed work in Target and auctions in Sotheby’s, I’m able to find solace in providing art at every level because I really believe art is for everyone, and everyone deserves a little bit of POST WOOK finery in their lives.\n\nOn the other hand, on-chain art has broken open the door for me to become a mad scientist for my ‘upper end’ artwork by creating art that uses blockchain as a medium, and honestly it’s become some of my favorite art to make. I’ve always had a soft spot for research, so being able to combine complex data sets and my creativity feels like a dream. To off-chain people, I like to explain this work sort of like the photographs from Harry Potter, except instead of using magic to animate the images, we use code and blockchain.\n\nI find it even cooler that I get to sit down with collectors that share my same data-driven interests and chat about the future of digital art. I honestly have to pinch myself sometimes because I feel like I truly have the best of both worlds with creating meticulously detailed on-chain art and aesthetically pleasing retail art.\n\nTell us more about “The Astronomer’s Daughter” series, and what can Bitcoin Conference or Inscribing Vegas attendees expect to see from this series in May? I heard a rumor that your dad might be making the trip.\n\nThe Astronomer’s Daughter has sort of become my favorite little brainchild, and it’s been really fun to watch it blossom. It’s a collection that honors my dad’s legacy working for NASA through the blended use of satellite data and my artistic style. I chose 100 rare satoshis with varying levels of astronomical and on-chain significance to showcase what happened in space that day.\n\nOf all the various components, the moon phases are accounted for as the moon displayed in each image, the constellation the moon passes through is represented by the color of the sky, any planets close to earth are displayed accordingly, the month and the season are shown as the landscape in the image, solar holidays (equinoxes and solstices) are recorded, and there’s a chromatic filter on top of every image based on the year of the satoshi to tie it all together.\n\nEach piece is then pulled together using recursion and inscribed directly on the satoshi that the artwork represents.\n\nIn May, I’m debuting five (5) physical shadow boxes of select pieces from The Astronomer’s Daughter to showcase each layer of the artwork, acting almost as a physical representation of each recursive element. These pieces will be on display in the Bitcoin Conference Las Vegas, and they’ll be a sight to see! And yes, Father Wook might even be there but I don’t want to give too much away – people will have to come see for themselves!\n\nSee Post Wook’s artwork at both Bitcoin Conference Las Vegas and Inscribing Vegas. Tickets for these events, along with access to a full range of after parties, are available as part of the Bitcoin Week bundle here: https://b.tc/conference/2025/bitcoin-week.\n\n",

    "full_content": "# Bill Miller IV Reveals Firm’s Investment in GME, Touts Bitcoin Treasury Strategy\n\nBill Miller IV backs GameStop and Strategy, calling Bitcoin treasury strategy a smart long-term play against fiat debasement.\n\nAuthor: Nick Ward | Date: April 2, 2025\n\nCategories: BITCOIN FOR CORPORATIONS, NEWS\n\nIn a recent interview, Bill Miller IV outlined his firm’s investment approach in a rapidly shifting macro environment, spotlighting GameStop as a new position and reiterating strong conviction in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) as the blueprint for Bitcoin treasury strategy. For Miller, corporate Bitcoin strategy is more than a hedge—it’s a signal of innovation, adaptability, and capital efficiency.\n\n### Strategy: Solving Corporate Finance Problems with Bitcoin\n\nMiller praised Strategy’s transformation from software company to capital allocator focused on Bitcoin. He emphasized that the company isn’t just investing in Bitcoin—it’s solving traditional corporate finance challenges through Bitcoin-backed innovation. Strategy continues to create access to Bitcoin across the capital stack, offering various instruments with different risk profiles—from equity to convertible notes.\n\nWhile some view the firm’s market premium as excessive, Miller sees it as deserved. He framed Strategy’s persistent accumulation of Bitcoin through share issuance as an intelligent response to monetary debasement and a model that others have yet to replicate effectively.\n\nHe also noted that the rebrand from MicroStrategy to Strategy marked a shift not just in name, but in purpose—cementing the company’s identity as a Bitcoin development company.\n\n### Not Every Company Can Be Strategy—But Many Can Start\n\nAccording to Miller, there’s a growing list of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets—more than 70 by his count—but his firm only invests in a select few. He emphasized that his team evaluates each one on its own merits, with a value-oriented lens and a clear focus on the core business.\n\nWhile not every company can become a Bitcoin development company like Strategy, Miller believes many can and should adopt Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. He described Bitcoin as a way for companies to preserve the purchasing power of their excess capital, especially in light of monetary policies designed to erode fiat value over time.\n\nHe emphasized that companies facing secular challenges—such as declining core businesses or structural industry shifts—may find in Bitcoin a meaningful way to preserve relevance and shareholder value.\n\n### New Position: GameStop Signals Memetic and Strategic Potential\n\nMiller confirmed a new starter position in GameStop, explaining that the decision was driven by the company’s recent capital raise and signs that it may be exploring a Bitcoin strategy. Though the position is small, it reflects his firm’s broader interest in companies that show signs of innovation and unorthodox capital allocation.\n\nHe highlighted Ryan Cohen’s role at GameStop as a potentially powerful catalyst, pointing to Cohen’s cultural influence and willingness to think outside traditional finance norms. The ability to shape narratives, Miller suggested, is increasingly important in a world where memetics and capital markets are intertwined.\n\nHe sees potential for GameStop to follow a path similar to Metaplanet or Strategy—retail businesses that have embraced Bitcoin in response to broader existential challenges.\n\n### Bitcoin as the Rational Response to Monetary Debasement\n\nMiller made the case for Bitcoin adoption as a response to ongoing monetary debasement. He explained that if policymakers openly target 2% annual inflation—or more—then it is rational for companies and individuals to move an equivalent portion of their fiat-denominated capital into Bitcoin.\n\nHe stressed that this isn’t a speculative move but a fundamental capital preservation strategy. The key, he noted, is holding Bitcoin over the long term and recognizing it as a way to transfer value into the future with a lower risk of purchasing power erosion.\n\nMiller also noted that more companies are waking up to this logic, especially as regulatory clarity improves. He expects adoption to continue accelerating and sees the current period as a pivotal moment for CFOs and corporate treasurers to take action.\n\n### A Call to Forward-Thinking Financial Leaders\n\nFor Miller, Bitcoin isn’t a temporary trade—it’s a long-term solution to structural problems in fiat finance. He believes corporate leaders who ignore this trend risk falling behind. The momentum, he says, is clear: more public companies are entering the space, and early adopters are beginning to outperform.\n\nStrategy remains the benchmark. GameStop, Metaplanet, and others may follow. But the broader takeaway is this: in a competitive, inflationary world, companies that fail to evolve risk irrelevance. Bitcoin offers a path forward—one rooted in long-term thinking and strategic capital deployment.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations. This article is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation to acquire, purchase, or subscribe for securities.\n\nTags: Bill Miller IV, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, gamestop, michael saylor, Strategy\n",

The Breez SDK was initially developed to simplify the process of integrating Lightning Network support into different consumer applications. Dozens of existing projects and companies currently build on Lightning using the SDK.\n\nThe SDK supports two methods of Lightning integration. Native, which allows app developers to integrate a Lightning wallet or functionality utilizing the Greenlight service offered by Blockstream, which allows the wallet provider to host a cloud based Lightning node for users while keeping private keys solely in the users control, and Nodeless, which allows Liquid support to seamlessly integrate with the Lightning Network. Both models supported in the SDK give full support to the range of features available on the Lightning Network, as well as Liquid, without the complexity of having to build support from scratch.\n\nMisty Breez is built on the Nodeless SDK tooling. This means that users’ coins are self-custodied on the Liquid sidechain, giving users the ability to fully control their own funds but also requiring the trust trade-offs involved in using the Liquid Network (i.e. that the majority Federation signers will remain honest and trustworthy).\n\nThe wallet supports BOLT 11 and BOLT 12 invoices, LNURL-Pay, Lightning Addresses, on-chain BTC addresses, and even Matt Corrallo’s BIP 353 using DNS to fetch payment details for another user’s wallet. It also supports offline payments based on mobile notifications in the phone’s operating system.\n\nBreez SDK’s goal is to provide developers with the tooling to build a seamless and use-case specific user experience with as little effort as possible. In that vein Misty Breez aims to set a benchmark for a simplified user experience that other developers can use as a reference for Lightning integration into their own applications, or even to build on top of Misty Breez itself. If you want, feel free to simply integrate the functionality you seek to build into Misty Breez itself and rebrand it however you want (it is 100% opensource).\n\nDocumentation for the Breez SDK Nodeless configuration used by Misty Breez is available here. The Github for the Misty Breez implementation is available here. Lastly, for users who wish to play around with the application, early access release is available here for Android, and here for iOS.\n\nA direct APK download is available here.\n\nAll the tooling for developers to build a new UX experience for users is here today.\n\nTags: Breez, Breez SDK, Misty Breez\n",

    "full_content": "# No Password Reset? How Frostr Saves Your Nostr Identity\n\nAuthor: Juan Galt | Date: April 2, 2025\n\nCategories: BUSINESS, FEATURED\n\nBorn out of a hackathon at TABCONF 2024, Frostr may have just solved Nostr’s most pernicious issue: the inability to reset your password if your private key gets compromised.Started in October of 2024, Frostr just announced the alpha release of Igloo and Frost2x, a desktop and accompanying browser extension key signers for the Nostr ecosystem.\n\nThe project was founded by Topher (cmdruid) who made his name as a Bitcoin engineer for developing Tapscript — a popular library for managing Taproot, Schnorr signatures, and Bitcoin transactions — and Austin (bitcoinplebdev) a Lightning developer for Voltage and founder of PlebDevs, a Lightning-powered developer education platform with over 500 enrolled students.\n\nWhile resetting a password may seem innocuous or like a simple UI feature, it’s not that easy. Let me take you on a journey of the complexity of the issue it solves and the magnitude of what is at stake if we fail to solve this apparently simple problem.\n\n### The Social Media Revolution\n\nSocial media has changed the world. And yet, we find ourselves in a strange place with our digital identities. Who we are online and how we assert ownership of our online profiles often depends on trusted third parties like Facebook that are too big to care about any individual customer and fundamentally have the power to change the rules at any time, or even cancel your account altogether.The deplatforming of controversial influencers and even politicians in recent years serve as examples of how this centralized power can be wielded. Perhaps the best-known illustration of this is the removal of U.S. President Donald Trump from both Facebook and Twitter shortly after the January 6 riots at the U.S. capitol, just days before the end of his first term.\n\nStill, much of the world continues to operate on this digital neo-feudalism structure. It seems there’s a fundamental problem with the “decentralization” of identity that is yet to be solved.\n\n### Modern-Day Bank Robbery\n\nIdentity systems are a critical layer of society. Whether you are a citizen of Rome 2,000 years ago or of the United States today, doors open and close based on what ID you hold. Today’s systems, as advanced as they may seem, rely on a pre-digital conception of identity and security: They depend on authenticating your face.The ID card itself, whether your driver’s license or passport, helps government employees, bank tellers and bar bouncers all over the world do a very simple thing: Decide if you look like the person on the official card, and then sort out if you are allowed access or not.But the world is changing fast. Neither the obscurity of your physical appearance nor the secret nature of your social security number (SSN) are what they were in the pre-internet world: Many people have published their full names and pictures to Facebook, and a series of hacks have leaked tons of SSN data to the dark web. (For example, the Equifax Data Breach in 2017, which affected 147.9 million Americans, or the National Public Data Breach of 2024 with over 200 million Americans compromised.)In the analog, pre-internet days, when a robber burst through the doors of their local bank, they would do so to take the cash, gold and tradable valuables stored in the vaults.But that’s no longer how things work. In the digital age, money is no longer cash. Fiat payments are often reversible, so if you hack into a bank and move money to your account somehow, not only can that be reversed, but you just exposed a link to your identity.Today, the online equivalent of a robber is not looking to steal cash, gold or other valuables, but rather, personal identity data.\n\nThat data can, in turn, be used to defraud those same banks, as well as businesses of all sizes.Indeed, identity fraud costs more than all other forms of theft combined, totaling over $56 billion in 2020.\n\nNot only have many of these centralized platforms had their data vaults hacked and their contents sold on the dark web for pennies on the dollar, but AI is improving quickly and has already passed the Turing test of image generation. We are at a point where rogue actors can create fake selfies holding fake IDs with leaked user data and fool the gatekeepers to your digital wealth.This threat is likely to incentivize change, and you can see the new efforts by tech companies and government institutions to upgrade identity systems. Take California’s mobile driver’s license app as an example, mDL — developed in partnership with both Google and Apple — is initially integrated with airports for identity verification. But the app also invites developers to integrate it as a form of authentication for websites in general. ID.me takes a similar approach and is already fully integrated with the IRS, boasting 136 million members.\n\nMany of these apps require face or fingerprint authentication, and ask for increasingly complex KYC selfies from their users who must hold up IDs and recent newspapers to be authenticated.\n\nDespite the obvious weakness of using your face to authenticate your identity in the age of Facebook, tech giants continue to rely on biometric data, combining it with mass surveillance tools seen in the social credit score systems being built up in China.\n\nTo have a chance at curbing what seems like fate in the digital age, before it comes to the West, we need an identity authentication system that is both secure and agnostic to biometric data. We need an identity system that does not rely on our face.\n\n### Enter Nostr, a Bitcoin-Era Identity and Social Media Protocol\n\nBorn out of the Bitcoin developer ecosystem, Nostr has quickly grown into a social media network in its own right.An abbreviation of “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” — a bit of a mouthful — Nostr empowers users to authenticate themselves into social media pseudonyms (nyms) and sign their posts with a Bitcoin-style private key. As a self-custody system that fundamentally democratizes the internet away from its current structure, it opens up a whole new set of possibilities for social media.Proponents of Nostr argue that users can finally own their own data and no longer need to depend on the charity or benevolence of the Silicon Valley giants when they decide to move platforms or pick the wrong political party.Nostr works via a distributed client-server network topology, which allows you to access content across various servers called relays. If one goes down or starts censoring users unfairly, chances are there’s another window into the Nostr content feed that will grant you access and allow you to publish your thoughts.\n\nThe dream of Nostr is to unlock a new generation of social media technology that does not turn users into products by mining their data, that does not force biometric authentication, compromising their privacy, and that allows developers to build in an open network whose cryptography and specs are already open source and which is natively integrated with Bitcoin, the internet’s money.\n\nCelebrities and users who wish to protect their Nostr brands from fake accounts trying to impersonate them can follow a standard similar to the one developed by Keybase, which asked users to publicly attest to their a keybase identity with their other social media accounts, consolidating markers of reputation into one cryptographically controlled identity. Though that is not currently a practice in Nostr, it is a problem reasonably well solved in a decentralized way by Keybase.\n\nHowever, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Pushing identity ownership to the edges comes with a whole new set of problems that up until now have not really been solved and which have personally held me back from investing in building up my brand on Nostr.\n\n### No Password Resets\n\nThere’s currently no real way to reset your password for a Nostr nym or identity. Built on a simple public key pair system, if your private key gets hacked or leaked, your identity is essentially now under the control of whoever got it. (You both have the secret, so no one has exclusive control of it.)This is a huge issue. Although the examples of such hacks are not too common, they are a significant deterrent for brands that might consider putting serious capital into building on this new social network protocol.This particular risk is made worse by the intended design of Nostr, which invites many different interfaces to be created to access content of various kinds with the same user identities and means that users give their private keys to multiple clients, thus multiplying the risk of compromise.One layer of defense that has been built up and become popular as a result is the idea of an external signer, often a browser extension like Alby that helps manage your private key as a kind of password manager, facilitating signing of content for you on the various Nostr platforms.While this works well enough today it doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. One mistake and the nym is effectively compromised, the value of that built-up brand or reputation not just harmed but potentially exploitable by scammers wearing your identity to harass your friends or customers.This is similar to the very common impersonation scams on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which clone your profile and DM your known associates with phishing schemes, but even worse. In Nostr such an attack would be done with your identity — not a fake profile — significantly harming confidence in the authenticity of all content for those who are aware of the issue.\n\nThe solution should be simple: just create a password reset feature. Right?Well, it turns out some very creative engineering is needed here, because password resets are basically only possible by giving up your control over your identity to a third party who can update a central database and give you a new key set.Until now, that is. Let’s dive into Frostr.\n\n### Frost a Breakthrough in Sovereign Key Management\n\nRecent breakthroughs in cryptography have opened new doors for self custody in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry. One specific innovation that is quickly entering the market is Frost, a Schnorr-based key management and key rotation scheme that achieves similar functionality as Bitcoin multi-signature addresses and transactions, but without the on-chain transactions costs or privacy trade-offs.\n\nSchnorr is a form of cryptography invented in the 1990s. A few years after the expiration of its European and U.S. patents, Schnorr started being discussed as a possible future upgrade to Bitcoin, and was ultimately introduced in the Taproot soft fork upgrade of 2020.\n\nThat same year Chelsea Komlo and Ian Goldberg published “FROST: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures”, a technical spec that set the foundation for its use in the Lightning Network infrastructure as well as new multi-signature schemes for self custody known as FROST.While the cryptography is complex and explaining it beyond the scope of this article, it resembles schemes like Shamir’s secret sharing. The cryptographic principles involved allow users to create a 24-word seed with Trezor’s hardware wallet, split up into three shares of 12 words each. Any two shares combined can be assembled into the master private key of the wallet, while any one share alone is insufficient to compromise or recover access to the account.\n\nHere’s a two-minute video explanation of FROST by Andrew Poelstra, Head of Research at Blockstream:\n\nThis same principle is used in FROST, a scheme which is designed to enable multi-party, multi-signature wallets, like those used by exchanges, potentially replacing multi-signature Bitcoin scripts, benefiting users with more privacy and lower costs.Frostr extends FROST by integrating it with Nostr’s relay protocol — hence the added “r” in the name. It also adapts the technology to single-user wallets, rather than industrial-grade, multi-user schemes, allowing simpler setups and unlocking key rotation (password resets) for individual users with single key pairs, like those used in Nostr.\n\nFrostr enables three new features in particular:\n\n- Threshold key signing, so that if one key gets compromised, it can be rotated out, and a fresh set of sub keys are generated, which generate the Nostr private keypair. No need to change your Nostr public and private keys (nsec). Similar to — for example — a 2-of-3 multisignature Bitcoin wallet, where if one key is lost or compromised, the other two can be used to move the coins to a new stable structure, and regain control of three fresh keys, but off-chain. It’s a magical thing.\n- No need for application-layer solutions to Nostr key rotation, only the key signers like Alby would have to integrate Frostr; Nostr apps like Primal or Damus would not even know that Frostr is being used for key rotation by its users.\n- Users who already have Nostr accounts, whose nsecs have not been compromised, do not need to migrate to new keypairs and identities but simply remove their nsecs from current key signers and start using Frostr as a more secure key management system instead.\n\nThe result? A major piece of the decentralized social media puzzle is unlocked: Trustless identities with password resets that do not depend on centralized gatekeepers for authentication.\n\nThe consequences of this innovation, if fruitful, are fundamental. The Nostr ecosystem would be wise to take a look at Frostr; it might just be enough of a security and UI improvement that a whole new generation of non-biometric, trustless digital identities, and sovereign data ownership use cases are unlocked for the Bitcoin age.For a deeper dive into Frostr, check out their website at Frostr.org or have a look at this podcast I recorded with Topher and Austin on the topic. https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/bitcoin-magazine-po/episodes/FROSTR-Explained-A-Gamechanger-for-NOSTR-Identity-Management–The-Juan-Galt-Show-e30op20\n\nTags: digital identity, FROST, Nostr, Schnorr, Surveillance\n",

But what makes this listing significant isn’t the transaction mechanics—it’s the capital strategy behind it.\n\n## BITCOIN BUILT INTO THE BALANCE SHEET\n\nSince 2023, The Smarter Web Company has accepted Bitcoin as payment. Now, as it prepares to list its shares, it’s laying the groundwork for a formal Digital Assets Treasury Policy—one that includes holding Bitcoin alongside cash.\n\nThe company’s leadership views Bitcoin not as a speculative play, but as a deliberate reserve asset. It is, in their words, a hedge against inflation and a forward-looking mechanism to preserve value over time.\n\nAs the company pursues both organic growth and strategic acquisitions post-listing, Bitcoin will serve as part of its long-term capital preservation toolkit—a move echoing the playbooks of early movers like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet.\n\n## BACKED BY BITCOIN-NATIVE CAPITAL\n\nThe company’s plans have already attracted aligned investors. In January 2025, The Smarter Web Company closed a pre-IPO funding round of more than £1 million, backed by UTXO Management—a Bitcoin-focused investment manager and operator of the hedge fund 210k Capital, LP.\n\nAn additional raise of over £2 million is underway as part of the company’s listing strategy.\n\nThis isn’t passive capital. UTXO and other mission-aligned backers are building a new class of public company—firms with long-term Bitcoin alignment and treasury discipline integrated from the start.\n\n## WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CORPORATE LEADERS\n\nOnce listed, The Smarter Web Company will become one of the first UK-listed businesses to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy from day one. That alone makes it notable. Most publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin did so as a pivot or response to broader macro shifts. Smarter Web is taking a different route—baking Bitcoin into its financial DNA before it ever hits the public markets.\n\nThis signals something much larger than a single company’s conviction. It shows that the Bitcoin treasury model is becoming accessible, practical, and strategically relevant for companies beyond the usual early adopters. You don’t need a multibillion-dollar balance sheet to begin integrating Bitcoin into your corporate strategy—you need alignment, vision, and a framework that prioritizes capital preservation and long-term value.\n\nFor mid-sized and growth-stage businesses, Bitcoin increasingly fits the bill. The same financial pressures that push large enterprises toward more efficient capital strategies—persistent inflation, fiat depreciation, and the opportunity cost of holding idle cash—apply equally, if not more urgently, to smaller firms operating in competitive environments.\n\nWhether it’s recurring revenue or future M&A, capital efficiency is a strategic imperative. Bitcoin offers a unique tool in that mix—one that traditional treasury assets cannot replicate. It’s portable, non-sovereign, resistant to dilution, and optimized for long time horizons. For companies seeking to store the value they’ve earned today and deploy it tomorrow without losing purchasing power, Bitcoin represents a new operating standard—not just a hedge.\n\n## THE PATH FORWARD\n\nAs public company disclosures begin post-listing, The Smarter Web Company has committed to including material treasury updates alongside core business performance—a level of transparency that will give investors and analysts insight into how digital assets play a role in managing corporate capital.\n\nBitcoin-native capital formation, treasury strategy, and operational adoption are no longer isolated to headline-making firms like Strategy and Metaplanet. The playbook is expanding, and companies like The Smarter Web Company are positioning themselves to lead a new chapter—where treasury innovation is a signal, not a stunt.\n\nFor corporate leaders, the lesson is clear: the barriers to action are falling. The only question that remains is timing.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations. This article is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation to acquire, purchase, or subscribe for securities. For full transparency, please note that UTXO Management, a subsidiary of BTC Inc., holds a stake in Smarter Web Company.\n\nTags: bitcoin treasury, bitcoin treasury company, Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, Corporate Bitcoin Strategy, smarter web company, UTXO Management\n",

Ron Reynolds and Mihaela Plesa.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, Texas’ comptroller would have the power to invest funds (up to $250 million, as mentioned) from the state’s Economic Stabilization Fund — colloquially referred to as the state’s “Rainy Day Fund”, which was created to serve as a savings account for the state and to prevent sudden notable cuts to schools, health care, or other vital state services — into bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt also authorizes municipalities or counties to invest up to $10 million of its funds or funds under its control into bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf the bill were to become law, it would take effect on September 1, 2025, which would provide state- and local-level government officials time to formulate an investment strategy as well as devise a plan for custody.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Laws, H.B. 4258 is one of eight currently active bitcoin- or crypto-related bills that have been introduced to either the Texas Senator or the state’s House of Representatives. Of the eight bills, it’s the fifth to move to committee.\n\nFour of these bills, including this current bill, would authorize the state to put bitcoin on its balance sheet in some fashion. The other three — H.B. 1598, Senate Bill (S.B.) 21 and S.B. 778 — all call for Texas to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR).\n\nThese three SBR bills are all in committee, with S.B. 21 now in its second round of review by committee. The bill recently passed the state Senate with a 25-5 vote.\n\nTexas remains the state with the second highest number of active bitcoin- and crypto-related bills, trailing behind only Arizona, which has nine active bills, three of which are close to being enacted into law.\n\nThe state continues to be one of the most Bitcoin-friendly states in the United States, as not only is it friendly to Bitcoin in a legislative sense, but it is currently home to approximately one-third of the U.S.’s total Bitcoin mining hash rate.\n\nTags: Legislation, Politics, Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Texas, Texas Bitcoin\n",

    "full_content": "# China’s Legalization of Bitcoin Mining Threatens Global Hashrate Distribution\n\nWill China re-legalize Bitcoin mining and completely upset global hashrate distribution?\n\nAuthor: Richard Greaser | Date: April 1, 2025\n\nCategories: NEWS, SPONSORED\n\nChina’s Communist Party announced today in a surprise move that it would be reversing its stance on Bitcoin mining, legalizing mining for Chinese entities and individuals. In 2021, the Chinese government banned Bitcoin mining, citing risks of capital flight, environmental challenges, and competition to their nation’s digital currencies.\n\nThe announcement came during growing tensions between the United States government and the world’s largest Bitcoin miner manufacturer, Chinese based Bitmain. Allegedly, Bitmain skirted US sanctions on providing companies such as Huawei with AI chips. Latley, US based Bitcoin miners have been facing seizures by customs of Bitmain miners without much explanation, as reported on by Blockspace.\n\nThe move comes at a time when mining profitability is squeezing many US based mining firms. Before the Chinese mining ban, some speculated that China housed up to 75% of the global Bitcoin hashrate. Some speculate that it still has up to 20% of the global hashrate despite the ban. China’s Re-legalization of Bitcoin mining poses the possibility of an explosion in network hashrate, threatening the viability of many American firms.\n\nToday China dominates global Bitcoin miner manufacturing with the three largest manufacturers: Bitmain, Micro BT, and Canaan, based in the communist nation. With rising tensions in trade wars, combined with the legalization of Chinese mining, many are fearful that China will restrict exports of Bitcoin mining machines to the west, meaning that the United States would be at a serious disadvantage. Luxor estimates that the United States currently has roughly 36% of the world’s hashrate with 17% of it estimated to be located in Texas.\n\nChina has been facing many economic headwinds due to the fall out of their restrictive Covid- 19 response, the deflation of their real estate bubble and the general global economic downturn and may be looking at Bitcoin as a way to help jump start their faltering economy.\n\nMany are speculating whether this move may mean that China will be changing its tune in regards to Bitcoin in general, seeking to try and outpace the United States in stockpiling the digital currency.\n\nIf the Chinese government were to restrict exports of Chinese made Bitcoin miners, it could put the United States years behind the land of the dragon. While TSMC (The world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors) has been building chip manufacturing plants in the United States, it will likely take some time for the other manufacturers based in the US to catch up with Bitmain, leading to a likely dominance of Bitcoin network hashrate by China.\n\nThere are some hopes though for preventing complete network centralization. “TSMC, based in Taiwan, could stop providing ASIC chips to Chinese manufacturers,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot Platforms. “This would hurt Bitcoin’s decentralization and could escalate tensions with China.” he explained. In recent yrars, China has been floating the idea of invading Taiwan. If China were to invade the island nation, that would only raise tensions with the west who has been on and off on whether they would provide military protections to Taiwan in the case of military conflict.\n\nChinese premier Xi Xinping has reportedly been meeting with Kim Jong Un in recent months, learning about the North Korean Bitcoin strategy.\n\nThis is a guest post by Bitcoin Bugle.
