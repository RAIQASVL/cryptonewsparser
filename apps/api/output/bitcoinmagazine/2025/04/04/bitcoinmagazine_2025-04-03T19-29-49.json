    "full_content": "# Bill Miller IV Reveals Firm’s Investment in GME, Touts Bitcoin Treasury Strategy\n\nBill Miller IV backs GameStop and Strategy, calling Bitcoin treasury strategy a smart long-term play against fiat debasement.\n\nAuthor: Nick Ward | Date: April 2, 2025\n\nCategories: BITCOIN FOR CORPORATIONS, NEWS\n\nIn a recent interview, Bill Miller IV outlined his firm’s investment approach in a rapidly shifting macro environment, spotlighting GameStop as a new position and reiterating strong conviction in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) as the blueprint for Bitcoin treasury strategy. For Miller, corporate Bitcoin strategy is more than a hedge—it’s a signal of innovation, adaptability, and capital efficiency.\n\n### Strategy: Solving Corporate Finance Problems with Bitcoin\n\nMiller praised Strategy’s transformation from software company to capital allocator focused on Bitcoin. He emphasized that the company isn’t just investing in Bitcoin—it’s solving traditional corporate finance challenges through Bitcoin-backed innovation. Strategy continues to create access to Bitcoin across the capital stack, offering various instruments with different risk profiles—from equity to convertible notes.\n\nWhile some view the firm’s market premium as excessive, Miller sees it as deserved. He framed Strategy’s persistent accumulation of Bitcoin through share issuance as an intelligent response to monetary debasement and a model that others have yet to replicate effectively.\n\nHe also noted that the rebrand from MicroStrategy to Strategy marked a shift not just in name, but in purpose—cementing the company’s identity as a Bitcoin development company.\n\n### Not Every Company Can Be Strategy—But Many Can Start\n\nAccording to Miller, there’s a growing list of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets—more than 70 by his count—but his firm only invests in a select few. He emphasized that his team evaluates each one on its own merits, with a value-oriented lens and a clear focus on the core business.\n\nWhile not every company can become a Bitcoin development company like Strategy, Miller believes many can and should adopt Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. He described Bitcoin as a way for companies to preserve the purchasing power of their excess capital, especially in light of monetary policies designed to erode fiat value over time.\n\nHe emphasized that companies facing secular challenges—such as declining core businesses or structural industry shifts—may find in Bitcoin a meaningful way to preserve relevance and shareholder value.\n\n### New Position: GameStop Signals Memetic and Strategic Potential\n\nMiller confirmed a new starter position in GameStop, explaining that the decision was driven by the company’s recent capital raise and signs that it may be exploring a Bitcoin strategy. Though the position is small, it reflects his firm’s broader interest in companies that show signs of innovation and unorthodox capital allocation.\n\nHe highlighted Ryan Cohen’s role at GameStop as a potentially powerful catalyst, pointing to Cohen’s cultural influence and willingness to think outside traditional finance norms. The ability to shape narratives, Miller suggested, is increasingly important in a world where memetics and capital markets are intertwined.\n\nHe sees potential for GameStop to follow a path similar to Metaplanet or Strategy—retail businesses that have embraced Bitcoin in response to broader existential challenges.\n\n### Bitcoin as the Rational Response to Monetary Debasement\n\nMiller made the case for Bitcoin adoption as a response to ongoing monetary debasement. He explained that if policymakers openly target 2% annual inflation—or more—then it is rational for companies and individuals to move an equivalent portion of their fiat-denominated capital into Bitcoin.\n\nHe stressed that this isn’t a speculative move but a fundamental capital preservation strategy. The key, he noted, is holding Bitcoin over the long term and recognizing it as a way to transfer value into the future with a lower risk of purchasing power erosion.\n\nMiller also noted that more companies are waking up to this logic, especially as regulatory clarity improves. He expects adoption to continue accelerating and sees the current period as a pivotal moment for CFOs and corporate treasurers to take action.\n\n### A Call to Forward-Thinking Financial Leaders\n\nFor Miller, Bitcoin isn’t a temporary trade—it’s a long-term solution to structural problems in fiat finance. He believes corporate leaders who ignore this trend risk falling behind. The momentum, he says, is clear: more public companies are entering the space, and early adopters are beginning to outperform.\n\nStrategy remains the benchmark. GameStop, Metaplanet, and others may follow. But the broader takeaway is this: in a competitive, inflationary world, companies that fail to evolve risk irrelevance. Bitcoin offers a path forward—one rooted in long-term thinking and strategic capital deployment.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations. This article is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation to acquire, purchase, or subscribe for securities.\n\nTags: Bill Miller IV, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, gamestop, michael saylor, Strategy\n",

The Breez SDK was initially developed to simplify the process of integrating Lightning Network support into different consumer applications. Dozens of existing projects and companies currently build on Lightning using the SDK.\n\nThe SDK supports two methods of Lightning integration. Native, which allows app developers to integrate a Lightning wallet or functionality utilizing the Greenlight service offered by Blockstream, which allows the wallet provider to host a cloud based Lightning node for users while keeping private keys solely in the users control, and Nodeless, which allows Liquid support to seamlessly integrate with the Lightning Network. Both models supported in the SDK give full support to the range of features available on the Lightning Network, as well as Liquid, without the complexity of having to build support from scratch.\n\nMisty Breez is built on the Nodeless SDK tooling. This means that users’ coins are self-custodied on the Liquid sidechain, giving users the ability to fully control their own funds but also requiring the trust trade-offs involved in using the Liquid Network (i.e. that the majority Federation signers will remain honest and trustworthy).\n\nThe wallet supports BOLT 11 and BOLT 12 invoices, LNURL-Pay, Lightning Addresses, on-chain BTC addresses, and even Matt Corrallo’s BIP 353 using DNS to fetch payment details for another user’s wallet. It also supports offline payments based on mobile notifications in the phone’s operating system.\n\nBreez SDK’s goal is to provide developers with the tooling to build a seamless and use-case specific user experience with as little effort as possible. In that vein Misty Breez aims to set a benchmark for a simplified user experience that other developers can use as a reference for Lightning integration into their own applications, or even to build on top of Misty Breez itself. If you want, feel free to simply integrate the functionality you seek to build into Misty Breez itself and rebrand it however you want (it is 100% opensource).\n\nDocumentation for the Breez SDK Nodeless configuration used by Misty Breez is available here. The Github for the Misty Breez implementation is available here. Lastly, for users who wish to play around with the application, early access release is available here for Android, and here for iOS.\n\nA direct APK download is available here.\n\nAll the tooling for developers to build a new UX experience for users is here today.\n\nTags: Breez, Breez SDK, Misty Breez\n",

    "full_content": "# No Password Reset? How Frostr Saves Your Nostr Identity\n\nAuthor: Juan Galt | Date: April 2, 2025\n\nCategories: BUSINESS, FEATURED\n\nBorn out of a hackathon at TABCONF 2024, Frostr may have just solved Nostr’s most pernicious issue: the inability to reset your password if your private key gets compromised.Started in October of 2024, Frostr just announced the alpha release of Igloo and Frost2x, a desktop and accompanying browser extension key signers for the Nostr ecosystem.\n\nThe project was founded by Topher (cmdruid) who made his name as a Bitcoin engineer for developing Tapscript — a popular library for managing Taproot, Schnorr signatures, and Bitcoin transactions — and Austin (bitcoinplebdev) a Lightning developer for Voltage and founder of PlebDevs, a Lightning-powered developer education platform with over 500 enrolled students.\n\nWhile resetting a password may seem innocuous or like a simple UI feature, it’s not that easy. Let me take you on a journey of the complexity of the issue it solves and the magnitude of what is at stake if we fail to solve this apparently simple problem.\n\n### The Social Media Revolution\n\nSocial media has changed the world. And yet, we find ourselves in a strange place with our digital identities. Who we are online and how we assert ownership of our online profiles often depends on trusted third parties like Facebook that are too big to care about any individual customer and fundamentally have the power to change the rules at any time, or even cancel your account altogether.The deplatforming of controversial influencers and even politicians in recent years serve as examples of how this centralized power can be wielded. Perhaps the best-known illustration of this is the removal of U.S. President Donald Trump from both Facebook and Twitter shortly after the January 6 riots at the U.S. capitol, just days before the end of his first term.\n\nStill, much of the world continues to operate on this digital neo-feudalism structure. It seems there’s a fundamental problem with the “decentralization” of identity that is yet to be solved.\n\n### Modern-Day Bank Robbery\n\nIdentity systems are a critical layer of society. Whether you are a citizen of Rome 2,000 years ago or of the United States today, doors open and close based on what ID you hold. Today’s systems, as advanced as they may seem, rely on a pre-digital conception of identity and security: They depend on authenticating your face.The ID card itself, whether your driver’s license or passport, helps government employees, bank tellers and bar bouncers all over the world do a very simple thing: Decide if you look like the person on the official card, and then sort out if you are allowed access or not.But the world is changing fast. Neither the obscurity of your physical appearance nor the secret nature of your social security number (SSN) are what they were in the pre-internet world: Many people have published their full names and pictures to Facebook, and a series of hacks have leaked tons of SSN data to the dark web. (For example, the Equifax Data Breach in 2017, which affected 147.9 million Americans, or the National Public Data Breach of 2024 with over 200 million Americans compromised.)In the analog, pre-internet days, when a robber burst through the doors of their local bank, they would do so to take the cash, gold and tradable valuables stored in the vaults.But that’s no longer how things work. In the digital age, money is no longer cash. Fiat payments are often reversible, so if you hack into a bank and move money to your account somehow, not only can that be reversed, but you just exposed a link to your identity.Today, the online equivalent of a robber is not looking to steal cash, gold or other valuables, but rather, personal identity data.\n\nThat data can, in turn, be used to defraud those same banks, as well as businesses of all sizes.Indeed, identity fraud costs more than all other forms of theft combined, totaling over $56 billion in 2020.\n\nNot only have many of these centralized platforms had their data vaults hacked and their contents sold on the dark web for pennies on the dollar, but AI is improving quickly and has already passed the Turing test of image generation. We are at a point where rogue actors can create fake selfies holding fake IDs with leaked user data and fool the gatekeepers to your digital wealth.This threat is likely to incentivize change, and you can see the new efforts by tech companies and government institutions to upgrade identity systems. Take California’s mobile driver’s license app as an example, mDL — developed in partnership with both Google and Apple — is initially integrated with airports for identity verification. But the app also invites developers to integrate it as a form of authentication for websites in general. ID.me takes a similar approach and is already fully integrated with the IRS, boasting 136 million members.\n\nMany of these apps require face or fingerprint authentication, and ask for increasingly complex KYC selfies from their users who must hold up IDs and recent newspapers to be authenticated.\n\nDespite the obvious weakness of using your face to authenticate your identity in the age of Facebook, tech giants continue to rely on biometric data, combining it with mass surveillance tools seen in the social credit score systems being built up in China.\n\nTo have a chance at curbing what seems like fate in the digital age, before it comes to the West, we need an identity authentication system that is both secure and agnostic to biometric data. We need an identity system that does not rely on our face.\n\n### Enter Nostr, a Bitcoin-Era Identity and Social Media Protocol\n\nBorn out of the Bitcoin developer ecosystem, Nostr has quickly grown into a social media network in its own right.An abbreviation of “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” — a bit of a mouthful — Nostr empowers users to authenticate themselves into social media pseudonyms (nyms) and sign their posts with a Bitcoin-style private key. As a self-custody system that fundamentally democratizes the internet away from its current structure, it opens up a whole new set of possibilities for social media.Proponents of Nostr argue that users can finally own their own data and no longer need to depend on the charity or benevolence of the Silicon Valley giants when they decide to move platforms or pick the wrong political party.Nostr works via a distributed client-server network topology, which allows you to access content across various servers called relays. If one goes down or starts censoring users unfairly, chances are there’s another window into the Nostr content feed that will grant you access and allow you to publish your thoughts.\n\nThe dream of Nostr is to unlock a new generation of social media technology that does not turn users into products by mining their data, that does not force biometric authentication, compromising their privacy, and that allows developers to build in an open network whose cryptography and specs are already open source and which is natively integrated with Bitcoin, the internet’s money.\n\nCelebrities and users who wish to protect their Nostr brands from fake accounts trying to impersonate them can follow a standard similar to the one developed by Keybase, which asked users to publicly attest to their a keybase identity with their other social media accounts, consolidating markers of reputation into one cryptographically controlled identity. Though that is not currently a practice in Nostr, it is a problem reasonably well solved in a decentralized way by Keybase.\n\nHowever, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Pushing identity ownership to the edges comes with a whole new set of problems that up until now have not really been solved and which have personally held me back from investing in building up my brand on Nostr.\n\n### No Password Resets\n\nThere’s currently no real way to reset your password for a Nostr nym or identity. Built on a simple public key pair system, if your private key gets hacked or leaked, your identity is essentially now under the control of whoever got it. (You both have the secret, so no one has exclusive control of it.)This is a huge issue. Although the examples of such hacks are not too common, they are a significant deterrent for brands that might consider putting serious capital into building on this new social network protocol.This particular risk is made worse by the intended design of Nostr, which invites many different interfaces to be created to access content of various kinds with the same user identities and means that users give their private keys to multiple clients, thus multiplying the risk of compromise.One layer of defense that has been built up and become popular as a result is the idea of an external signer, often a browser extension like Alby that helps manage your private key as a kind of password manager, facilitating signing of content for you on the various Nostr platforms.While this works well enough today it doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. One mistake and the nym is effectively compromised, the value of that built-up brand or reputation not just harmed but potentially exploitable by scammers wearing your identity to harass your friends or customers.This is similar to the very common impersonation scams on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which clone your profile and DM your known associates with phishing schemes, but even worse. In Nostr such an attack would be done with your identity — not a fake profile — significantly harming confidence in the authenticity of all content for those who are aware of the issue.\n\nThe solution should be simple: just create a password reset feature. Right?Well, it turns out some very creative engineering is needed here, because password resets are basically only possible by giving up your control over your identity to a third party who can update a central database and give you a new key set.Until now, that is. Let’s dive into Frostr.\n\n### Frost a Breakthrough in Sovereign Key Management\n\nRecent breakthroughs in cryptography have opened new doors for self custody in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry. One specific innovation that is quickly entering the market is Frost, a Schnorr-based key management and key rotation scheme that achieves similar functionality as Bitcoin multi-signature addresses and transactions, but without the on-chain transactions costs or privacy trade-offs.\n\nSchnorr is a form of cryptography invented in the 1990s. A few years after the expiration of its European and U.S. patents, Schnorr started being discussed as a possible future upgrade to Bitcoin, and was ultimately introduced in the Taproot soft fork upgrade of 2020.\n\nThat same year Chelsea Komlo and Ian Goldberg published “FROST: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures”, a technical spec that set the foundation for its use in the Lightning Network infrastructure as well as new multi-signature schemes for self custody known as FROST.While the cryptography is complex and explaining it beyond the scope of this article, it resembles schemes like Shamir’s secret sharing. The cryptographic principles involved allow users to create a 24-word seed with Trezor’s hardware wallet, split up into three shares of 12 words each. Any two shares combined can be assembled into the master private key of the wallet, while any one share alone is insufficient to compromise or recover access to the account.\n\nHere’s a two-minute video explanation of FROST by Andrew Poelstra, Head of Research at Blockstream:\n\nThis same principle is used in FROST, a scheme which is designed to enable multi-party, multi-signature wallets, like those used by exchanges, potentially replacing multi-signature Bitcoin scripts, benefiting users with more privacy and lower costs.Frostr extends FROST by integrating it with Nostr’s relay protocol — hence the added “r” in the name. It also adapts the technology to single-user wallets, rather than industrial-grade, multi-user schemes, allowing simpler setups and unlocking key rotation (password resets) for individual users with single key pairs, like those used in Nostr.\n\nFrostr enables three new features in particular:\n\n- Threshold key signing, so that if one key gets compromised, it can be rotated out, and a fresh set of sub keys are generated, which generate the Nostr private keypair. No need to change your Nostr public and private keys (nsec). Similar to — for example — a 2-of-3 multisignature Bitcoin wallet, where if one key is lost or compromised, the other two can be used to move the coins to a new stable structure, and regain control of three fresh keys, but off-chain. It’s a magical thing.\n- No need for application-layer solutions to Nostr key rotation, only the key signers like Alby would have to integrate Frostr; Nostr apps like Primal or Damus would not even know that Frostr is being used for key rotation by its users.\n- Users who already have Nostr accounts, whose nsecs have not been compromised, do not need to migrate to new keypairs and identities but simply remove their nsecs from current key signers and start using Frostr as a more secure key management system instead.\n\nThe result? A major piece of the decentralized social media puzzle is unlocked: Trustless identities with password resets that do not depend on centralized gatekeepers for authentication.\n\nThe consequences of this innovation, if fruitful, are fundamental. The Nostr ecosystem would be wise to take a look at Frostr; it might just be enough of a security and UI improvement that a whole new generation of non-biometric, trustless digital identities, and sovereign data ownership use cases are unlocked for the Bitcoin age.For a deeper dive into Frostr, check out their website at Frostr.org or have a look at this podcast I recorded with Topher and Austin on the topic. https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/bitcoin-magazine-po/episodes/FROSTR-Explained-A-Gamechanger-for-NOSTR-Identity-Management–The-Juan-Galt-Show-e30op20\n\nTags: digital identity, FROST, Nostr, Schnorr, Surveillance\n",

But what makes this listing significant isn’t the transaction mechanics—it’s the capital strategy behind it.\n\n## BITCOIN BUILT INTO THE BALANCE SHEET\n\nSince 2023, The Smarter Web Company has accepted Bitcoin as payment. Now, as it prepares to list its shares, it’s laying the groundwork for a formal Digital Assets Treasury Policy—one that includes holding Bitcoin alongside cash.\n\nThe company’s leadership views Bitcoin not as a speculative play, but as a deliberate reserve asset. It is, in their words, a hedge against inflation and a forward-looking mechanism to preserve value over time.\n\nAs the company pursues both organic growth and strategic acquisitions post-listing, Bitcoin will serve as part of its long-term capital preservation toolkit—a move echoing the playbooks of early movers like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet.\n\n## BACKED BY BITCOIN-NATIVE CAPITAL\n\nThe company’s plans have already attracted aligned investors. In January 2025, The Smarter Web Company closed a pre-IPO funding round of more than £1 million, backed by UTXO Management—a Bitcoin-focused investment manager and operator of the hedge fund 210k Capital, LP.\n\nAn additional raise of over £2 million is underway as part of the company’s listing strategy.\n\nThis isn’t passive capital. UTXO and other mission-aligned backers are building a new class of public company—firms with long-term Bitcoin alignment and treasury discipline integrated from the start.\n\n## WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CORPORATE LEADERS\n\nOnce listed, The Smarter Web Company will become one of the first UK-listed businesses to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy from day one. That alone makes it notable. Most publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin did so as a pivot or response to broader macro shifts. Smarter Web is taking a different route—baking Bitcoin into its financial DNA before it ever hits the public markets.\n\nThis signals something much larger than a single company’s conviction. It shows that the Bitcoin treasury model is becoming accessible, practical, and strategically relevant for companies beyond the usual early adopters. You don’t need a multibillion-dollar balance sheet to begin integrating Bitcoin into your corporate strategy—you need alignment, vision, and a framework that prioritizes capital preservation and long-term value.\n\nFor mid-sized and growth-stage businesses, Bitcoin increasingly fits the bill. The same financial pressures that push large enterprises toward more efficient capital strategies—persistent inflation, fiat depreciation, and the opportunity cost of holding idle cash—apply equally, if not more urgently, to smaller firms operating in competitive environments.\n\nWhether it’s recurring revenue or future M&A, capital efficiency is a strategic imperative. Bitcoin offers a unique tool in that mix—one that traditional treasury assets cannot replicate. It’s portable, non-sovereign, resistant to dilution, and optimized for long time horizons. For companies seeking to store the value they’ve earned today and deploy it tomorrow without losing purchasing power, Bitcoin represents a new operating standard—not just a hedge.\n\n## THE PATH FORWARD\n\nAs public company disclosures begin post-listing, The Smarter Web Company has committed to including material treasury updates alongside core business performance—a level of transparency that will give investors and analysts insight into how digital assets play a role in managing corporate capital.\n\nBitcoin-native capital formation, treasury strategy, and operational adoption are no longer isolated to headline-making firms like Strategy and Metaplanet. The playbook is expanding, and companies like The Smarter Web Company are positioning themselves to lead a new chapter—where treasury innovation is a signal, not a stunt.\n\nFor corporate leaders, the lesson is clear: the barriers to action are falling. The only question that remains is timing.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations. This article is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation to acquire, purchase, or subscribe for securities. For full transparency, please note that UTXO Management, a subsidiary of BTC Inc., holds a stake in Smarter Web Company.\n\nTags: bitcoin treasury, bitcoin treasury company, Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, Corporate Bitcoin Strategy, smarter web company, UTXO Management\n",

Ron Reynolds and Mihaela Plesa.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, Texas’ comptroller would have the power to invest funds (up to $250 million, as mentioned) from the state’s Economic Stabilization Fund — colloquially referred to as the state’s “Rainy Day Fund”, which was created to serve as a savings account for the state and to prevent sudden notable cuts to schools, health care, or other vital state services — into bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt also authorizes municipalities or counties to invest up to $10 million of its funds or funds under its control into bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf the bill were to become law, it would take effect on September 1, 2025, which would provide state- and local-level government officials time to formulate an investment strategy as well as devise a plan for custody.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Laws, H.B. 4258 is one of eight currently active bitcoin- or crypto-related bills that have been introduced to either the Texas Senator or the state’s House of Representatives. Of the eight bills, it’s the fifth to move to committee.\n\nFour of these bills, including this current bill, would authorize the state to put bitcoin on its balance sheet in some fashion. The other three — H.B. 1598, Senate Bill (S.B.) 21 and S.B. 778 — all call for Texas to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR).\n\nThese three SBR bills are all in committee, with S.B. 21 now in its second round of review by committee. The bill recently passed the state Senate with a 25-5 vote.\n\nTexas remains the state with the second highest number of active bitcoin- and crypto-related bills, trailing behind only Arizona, which has nine active bills, three of which are close to being enacted into law.\n\nThe state continues to be one of the most Bitcoin-friendly states in the United States, as not only is it friendly to Bitcoin in a legislative sense, but it is currently home to approximately one-third of the U.S.’s total Bitcoin mining hash rate.\n\nTags: Legislation, Politics, Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Texas, Texas Bitcoin\n",

    "full_content": "# China’s Legalization of Bitcoin Mining Threatens Global Hashrate Distribution\n\nWill China re-legalize Bitcoin mining and completely upset global hashrate distribution?\n\nAuthor: Richard Greaser | Date: April 1, 2025\n\nCategories: NEWS, SPONSORED\n\nChina’s Communist Party announced today in a surprise move that it would be reversing its stance on Bitcoin mining, legalizing mining for Chinese entities and individuals. In 2021, the Chinese government banned Bitcoin mining, citing risks of capital flight, environmental challenges, and competition to their nation’s digital currencies.\n\nThe announcement came during growing tensions between the United States government and the world’s largest Bitcoin miner manufacturer, Chinese based Bitmain. Allegedly, Bitmain skirted US sanctions on providing companies such as Huawei with AI chips. Latley, US based Bitcoin miners have been facing seizures by customs of Bitmain miners without much explanation, as reported on by Blockspace.\n\nThe move comes at a time when mining profitability is squeezing many US based mining firms. Before the Chinese mining ban, some speculated that China housed up to 75% of the global Bitcoin hashrate. Some speculate that it still has up to 20% of the global hashrate despite the ban. China’s Re-legalization of Bitcoin mining poses the possibility of an explosion in network hashrate, threatening the viability of many American firms.\n\nToday China dominates global Bitcoin miner manufacturing with the three largest manufacturers: Bitmain, Micro BT, and Canaan, based in the communist nation. With rising tensions in trade wars, combined with the legalization of Chinese mining, many are fearful that China will restrict exports of Bitcoin mining machines to the west, meaning that the United States would be at a serious disadvantage. Luxor estimates that the United States currently has roughly 36% of the world’s hashrate with 17% of it estimated to be located in Texas.\n\nChina has been facing many economic headwinds due to the fall out of their restrictive Covid- 19 response, the deflation of their real estate bubble and the general global economic downturn and may be looking at Bitcoin as a way to help jump start their faltering economy.\n\nMany are speculating whether this move may mean that China will be changing its tune in regards to Bitcoin in general, seeking to try and outpace the United States in stockpiling the digital currency.\n\nIf the Chinese government were to restrict exports of Chinese made Bitcoin miners, it could put the United States years behind the land of the dragon. While TSMC (The world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors) has been building chip manufacturing plants in the United States, it will likely take some time for the other manufacturers based in the US to catch up with Bitmain, leading to a likely dominance of Bitcoin network hashrate by China.\n\nThere are some hopes though for preventing complete network centralization. “TSMC, based in Taiwan, could stop providing ASIC chips to Chinese manufacturers,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot Platforms. “This would hurt Bitcoin’s decentralization and could escalate tensions with China.” he explained. In recent yrars, China has been floating the idea of invading Taiwan. If China were to invade the island nation, that would only raise tensions with the west who has been on and off on whether they would provide military protections to Taiwan in the case of military conflict.\n\nChinese premier Xi Xinping has reportedly been meeting with Kim Jong Un in recent months, learning about the North Korean Bitcoin strategy.\n\nThis is a guest post by Bitcoin Bugle.

    "full_content": "# Leaked Pete Hegseth Group Chat Messages Suggest Trump Considering Nationalizing Michael Saylor’s Company Strategy\n\nIs Donald Trump planning to nationalize Strategy in a plan to bolster the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve?\n\nAuthor: Richard Greaser | Date: April 1, 2025\n\nCategories: NEWS, SPONSORED\n\nOn Monday, the Atlantic released a series of unredacted messages from a Signal chat including various Trump administration officials discussing the administration’s desire to nationalize Strategy (formally Microstrategy) as a way to bolster the United States Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in a “budget neutral” manner.\n\nBelow are the text messages that Hegseth sent to the group of 18 senior Trump officials on March 31, according to screenshots released by The Atlantic on Monday.\n\n- TEAM UPDATE:\n- 1000et: Strategy has been amassing Bitcoin for us. Saylor is prepared to run damage control from potential fallout.\n- 1030et: Not sure how this move will negatively impact the price of the president’s Solana Meme Coin.\n- 1045: Discussing strategies with social media influencers to spin narrative away from this being an executive order 6102 like event.\n- 1055: President is concerned David Bailey will uninvite him from the Bitcoin conference if he makes this move.\n- 1100: Jason Lowery advises to do it. Says it plays perfectly into his Softwar thesis.\n- 1130: Brian Armstrong is also asking for Coinbase to be nationalized as well. It seems like he gets off on complying however he can.\n- 1145: POTUS is advising to hold off until more research can be done on potential implications to his meme coin prices. MORE TO FOLLOW. We are currently clean on OPSEC. Godspeed to our crypto bags.\n\nThe messages were leaked to the Atlantic by an unnamed PODCONF official who was mistakenly added to the group chat and is concerned the events could undermine Bitcoin’s “Number Go Up.”\n\nWhy defense secretary Pete Hegseth is involved: Bitcoin seems to be a growing part of the Trump Administration’s national security policy. Financial sovereignty is a substantial part of national defense. Some speculate that Donald Trump is very proud of the way that Hegseth handled the bombing of Yemen last week.\n\nWhy it matters: Many Bitcoin users have been critical of Strategy, due to its close proximity to Langley, VA as well its choice to custody funds with Coinbase, who also custody funds for  the United States government. The leaked Signal group chat log suggests that Strategy may have been operating as a front for the US government to amass a large portion of Bitcoin. A common saying in the Bitcoin community is “Not your keys, not your coins,” pointing to how the digital currency could be arbitrarily confiscated by governments if held by 3rd parties.\n\nWhat Hegseth is saying: It appears Hegseth understands this will likely be an unpopular move both in the business world and the Bitcoin ecosystem. When a government nationalizes a company in order to take control of their assets, it can cause uncertainty in the business world. It seems that the Trump administration is working with a series of media personalities and influencers to try and craft a narrative in an effort to manage any tensions or fallout that could result from this move.\n\nHow this could impact Bitcoin Price: Analysts we have talked with are ambivalent on  how the nationalization of Strategy could impact the price of Bitcoin. In the short term it may cause fear and uncertainty leading to a sell off, but many believe that it’s good for price in the long term as once again, it would be a vote of confidence in the digital currency from the world’s most powerful government.\n\nWill this leak unwind the plan: The leak may have foiled the Trump Administration’s plans, yet it is unsure if they were  planning on doing this versus just exploring the possibility. In 1962 the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented a plan to President Kennedy called Operation Northwoods in which acts of terrorism carried out by US intelligence agencies would be committed on US soil in an attempt to manufacture consent for the invasion of Cuba. From Hegseth’s messages, the president appeared hesitant as the move may have negative impacts on the price of his cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nThis story is continuing to break.

    "full_content": "# Swan Bitcoin HR Department To Provide Crisis Counseling For Those Negatively Impacted By Maxi Madness\n\nDid Maxi Madness this year push Bitcoiners too far?\n\nAuthor: Richard Greaser | Date: April 1, 2025\n\nCategories: NEWS, SPONSORED\n\nLast week rumours circulated that Swan’s HR department advised their C Suite to take a mental health day following the shocking ‘Maxi Madness’ results of X (Previously Twitter). Bitcoin Bugle’s annual popularity tournament took a strange turn when 16 seed wildcard Teddy Bitcoins defeated Bitcoin fan favorite, Adam Back.\n\nDuring the seven rounds of polling, Bitcoin maximalists followed in horror as Twitter villain and rumored felon Teddy Bitcoin overtook the prestigious news agency’s race with a wild voter turnout that put to shame Biden’s 2020 successful US elections sweep.\n\nIn the PODCONF sponsored showdown, Teddy Bitcoin beat legendary Bitcoin maximalists including Greg Zaj, Hodl Magoo, Adam Back, the lovely Lyn Alden and defending champion Yellow, concluding the ‘Maxi’ championship by defeating Strategy CEO Michael Saylor by a large margin.The final poll drew over 90 thousand votes, a record in the championship’s history.\n\nAt first drawing enthusiasm and sportsmanship, the tournament took a dark turn after Teddy beat championed memer Yellow in the 4rd round. The social media platform increasingly roared with ‘rees’ and accusations as Bitcoin purists searched for who to blame. Online commentators accused PODCONF, the auditor of the contest, with corruption and mismanagement. Many of these conspiracy theorists spread unsubstantiated claims on the fairness of the voting system.\n\nSwanning to the Rescue\n\nSwan Bitcoin, a Bitcoin brokerage service with strong brand recognition thanks to its ‘Bitcoin Maxi’ identity politics, had many employees upset by these events. Swan’s C Suite was seen protesting Teddy Bitcoin in numerous online posts, calling him a scammer, before simmering down during the alleged mental health day.\n\nText for image: Swan co-founder tweeted in support of inventor of proof-of-work Adam Beck competing agiainst his fellow $MSTR enthusiets Teddy Bitcoin\n\nAshley Marchetta, Swan’s head of Culture and People answered our request for comment: “Identity is central not only to Swan Bitcoin’s marketing and sales strategy but to our culture as a Bitcoin company. Teddy Bitcoin’s win in Maxi Madness was a clear attack on our business’ and customer’s core identity. Being a Bitcoin Maxi isn’t just about being ‘Bitcoin only’ but about ambition and keeping things clean. In our team’s view, The Bugle has slandered Bitcoin Maximalism by letting shitcoiners like Jason Williams and Teddy Bitcoins into this prestigious Maxi only tournament. These outcomes created immense mental damage to our community. We know this has been tough on the ecosystem, and are now providing community crisis counseling.”  Marchetta added that they would be tasking Swan’s HR department with offering their counseling services to the broader community to help reaffirm their identities as Bitcoin maxis.\n\nIs this good use of the firm’s resources? Many expect this move will help gain favor for Swan in the Bitcoin community which has seen a rise of Antiswanitism over the last year.\n\nIf you’re feeling distressed following Maxi Madness, please email: crisissupport@swanbitcoin.com.\n\nThis is a guest post by Bitcoin Bugle.

    "full_content": "# Covenants, CTV, And Making Things Easier For Developers\n\nStu is an opensource developer who has gone from working at ZBD, to building prototypes for CTV tools, to now contributing to the Char Network.\n\nAuthor: Shinobi | Date: April 3, 2025\n\nCategories: BUILDERS, FEATURED\n\nBuilder: Stu\n\nLanguage(s): Rust\n\nContributes To: CTV Prototypes, Char Network\n\nWork(s/ed) At: ZBD\n\nBefore Bitcoin, Stu spent his days working as a Windows System Administrator and in IT Support. His routine consisted of long boring days of sitting in a chair engaging in monotonous maintenance work, reconfiguring systems, and resetting passwords for users who’d forgotten them.\n\nIt was the kind of job where a problem occurring that actually requires you to engage your attention in a meaningful way is so rare an occurrence that you wind up sitting around hoping for something like that to happen most of the time.\n\nStu spent most days just browsing through Reddit threads during his copious amounts of downtime. But this turned out to not be such a bad scenario in the end, as this was how Stu found himself pulled into the Bitcoin space around 2017.\n\nLike many Bitcoiners, or rather soon-to-be Bitcoiners, back in that period, Stu got sucked into the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and altcoin frenzy of the time. Also, like many Bitcoiners around that time, he wound up getting burned financially by some bad investments in random unknown projects in which he probably shouldn’t have invested in the first place.\n\nInevitably the gravity of Bitcoin pulled him down the proverbial rabbit hole.\n\nAfter a few years of learning more deeply about Bitcoin, Stu hit a period of frenzy and quit his job at the peak of the 2021 bull market to look for opportunities to work in the Bitcoin space. By that time the programming language Rust had become widely used in different Bitcoin projects and libraries, so Stu began learning it so that he could contribute to Bitcoin.\n\nTowards the end of 2022, his search for a job in the space ended when he was hired by Michael Tildwell to work at ZBD, a company that integrates bitcoin payments into videogames using the Lightning Network.\n\n## Working At ZBD\n\nStu worked DevOps at ZBD, but in his free time he kept working at prototype Rust projects.\n\n“Most of my side projects are related to what I was interested in at the time, as I was working at ZBD I started making games that could use bitcoin,” Stu told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nTo start, he built a multiplayer web game, rain.run, based around players collecting lightning bolts for rewards in satoshis, to get more familiar with building applications that have to talk to each other over a network. Afterwards he built a simple connect4 game played over the Nostr protocol.\n\n“[This] was a great way to learn how Nostr worked,” said Stu.\n\n“I attended btc++ in Austin in 2024, which was the Script edition.” The four day conference was the most dense forum for discussion around Bitcoin script improvements and covenants in the last year or so.\n\n“There seemed to be, at the time, some kind of consensus developing for covenants on Bitcoin,” recalled Stu.\n\n“This got me really interested in how Bitcoin script worked and [led] me to experimenting with Taproot and Bitcoin scripts…” he added.\n\n“I didn’t really end up with much but it was a great way to learn how scripts worked.”\n\n## TABConf, Payment Pools, and CTV\n\nIn 2024, Stu attended TABConf, another developer-focused conference, which is held yearly in Atlanta, Georgia. The conversations in Atlanta also revolved heavily around covenants.\n\nLike all developer-focused conferences, TABConf put on a hackathon. Stu chose to build a project using Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), which enabled users to bet on the outcome of  chess matches. It became very obvious to Stu that building software around pre-signing large numbers of transactions introduced a lot of complexity for developers.\n\nDiscussing this issue, he said: “The answer to this problem seemed to be CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV). As I wanted to learn more about covenants, CTV seemed like a good place to start, so I started integrating CTV into my DLC chess project. I couldn’t believe how simple it made everything…”\n\nStu went on to build a proof-of-concept prototype of a Payment Pool using CTV. Payment pools are a very basic layer 2 system where groups of larger than two share control over a single unspent bitcoin output.\n\n“One way we can scale bitcoin to be used by everyone, without using centralized third parties, is for users to share UTXO’s,” he said when asked why he chose to work on a proof-of-concept for a payment pool. “Payment pools are a great way to do this, especially alongside other layer 2 solutions such as Lightning or Ark.”\n\n## Covenants\n\nCovenants have become a contentious issue in the discussion about where to take Bitcoin going forward. Every developer has their personal opinion on them, and Stu is no exception.\n\n“I think using covenants to replace pre-signed transactions alone is an amazing improvement for developers to build faster and safer,” he said. “It removes a lot of interactivity and friction for users, so there is less need for them to be online or coordinate with other parties, which can improve the user experience by a great deal.”\n\nI asked him if this is what drew him to building proof-of-concepts and prototypes using CTV as opposed to other covenant proposals.\n\n“I was drawn to CTV because it was so simple to implement in the applications I wanted to build. Once I built the payment pool with CTV, I was planning on doing the same for all covenant proposals. I figured out how to get the exact same functionality with CAT, but it just took a very long time to get working, and added way more code. The Bitcoin script was like 50 lines of code, compared to CTV with like 3 lines.”\n\n“I’m pretty sure there is consensus between protocol developers that there is no risk to Bitcoin if we enabled CTV…” he said. “…so the argument now seems to be that the users don’t want it. But the users are already using applications and protocols such as Lightning and multisig vaults that would be improved by CTV. So…I think it should be the priority for the next soft fork…”\n\nWhen asked about the current contentious nature of the discussion around covenants and the next soft fork, and how the atmosphere could be improved, he had this to say:\n\n“Someone needs to get Saylor to tweet a sandwich emoji and everything will be good.”\n\n“But seriously, I don’t really know. Maybe more in person events where people can discuss face to face would help. It doesn’t seem like much of a technical reason that we aren’t making progress, more of a political one,” he went on to say in a more serious tone.\n\n“I think some of the hesitance is more around making any change at all to Bitcoin. The reason it is so hard to change is an amazing property of Bitcoin, but it doesn’t have to extend to soft forks quite so much. It causes a lot of stress for certain Bitcoin developers, especially Bitcoin Core maintainers. Everyone is waiting on their opinion on the next fork, which seems to make them hesitant on joining in the conversation at all, which makes it hard to get consensus on any new change,” he said.\n\n## The Future\n\nStu recently participated in the Bitcoin Open Source Software (BOSS) program by Chaincode Labs, a program designed as a way for developers new to the Bitcoin ecosystem to cut their teeth and quickly develop a deeper understanding of and experience with building on Bitcoin.\n\nGoing forward Stu is going to contribute to the Char Network, a somewhat off the radar effort to build a new bitcoin staking platform led by Jeremy Rubin, the developer who designed and proposed CTV. He plans to continue working on his personal side projects and contributing to open source projects as well, with the eventual goal of starting to contribute to Bitcoin Core itself.\n\nStu had this to say about Bitcoiners’ priorities going into the future:\n\n“Our number one focus should be on making self custody better. It really sucks right now, and I think more Bitcoiners in general need to admit that. Backing up 12 words does sound simple, but it really isn’t that easy, and no one is doing it.”\n\nTags: CAT, Char Network, Covenants, CTV, Payment Pools\n",
