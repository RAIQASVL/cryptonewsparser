This initiative, approved by an overwhelming majority of its membership, was executed with the assistance of Proof of Workforce, a nonprofit dedicated to helping unions adopt Bitcoin through education-based initiatives.\n\nIATSE Local 728 said it has long championed service, strength, and solidarity, and its decision to invest in Bitcoin aligns with its mission to fight for financial security for its members. “Today, we make history as the first private-sector labor union in the country to put Bitcoin on our balance sheet and hold it in self-custody,” the union stated. The effort was led by IATSE Local 728 Treasurer Pascal Guillemard, former Executive Board Member Jason Lord, and current Board Member David Graves, in collaboration with Proof of Workforce founder Dom Bei.\n\n“IATSE Local 728 has led the entertainment industry in safety, technology, and training since 1939. Our members have been the proof of work behind the greatest productions in history—now, we’re bringing that same innovation to finance,” stated the IATSE Local 728 Bitcoin Advisory Board. “As the first private-sector labor union in the country to put Bitcoin on its balance sheet and hold it in self-custody, we are taking a stand for financial security and labor empowerment.”\n\n“This is about protecting the value of our members’ labor. Bitcoin isn’t just an asset, it’s the most secure, decentralized financial network in the world, immune to manipulation and inflation. While governments print money and financial institutions strip workers of their wages, we are taking control. This isn’t a gamble. It’s a strategy. We are learning, building, and leading,” the union continued.\n\nBeyond its own membership, IATSE Local 728 sees this move as a catalyst for a broader transformation within the labor movement. “For too long, unions have played defense in a system rigged against workers. That ends now. With Bitcoin, we aren’t just negotiating contracts, we are securing economic freedom. We are setting the standard. We are taking action. We are proving that unions don’t just fight for today, they build for the future.”\n\nIn addition to holding bitcoin on the balance sheet, a standing committee will be established to explore ways Bitcoin can provide long-term security for IATSE 728 members and their families. The committee will also help integrate the union’s support into the Bitcoin network.\n\nProof of Workforce praised IATSE 728’s leadership in adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, stating, “At Proof of Workforce, we understand that within every organization, exists someone who has discovered the true potential of Bitcoin. Our mission is to provide that person with the tools to introduce education-based and responsible adoption to their organization. IATSE Local 728 is a representation of the Proof of Work behind some of the best entertainment in the world. Their members work incredibly hard in motion picture and television lighting, ensuring the highest standards in the industry. They now have begun to explore an innovative network, aligned with the values and proof of work exhibited by its members. It’s now Lights, Camera, Bitcoin!”\n\nAs the first private-sector union to integrate Bitcoin into its financial strategy, IATSE Local 728 is setting a precedent that could inspire other private-sector unions across the country to follow suit.\n\nYesterday, Dom Bei announced he’s running for a a seat on the board of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). Bei launched his campaign with massive endorsements, including California legislators and the city of Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim.\n\nТеги: Bitcoin, IATSE Local 728, Proof Of Workforce, Union\n"

    "full_content": "# Low Fees Are A Symptom Of Deeper Problems\n\nPeople tend to see low fee environments as a positive thing, a time to save money on using bitcoin. They are not.\n\nАвтор: Shinobi | Дата: March 12, 2025\n\nКатегории: TAKES, FEATURED\n\nPeople tend to celebrate periods of low feerates. It’s time to clean house, consolidate any UTXOs you need to, open or close any Lightning channels you’ve been waiting on, and inscribe some stupid 8-bit jpeg into the blockchain. They’re perceived as a positive time.\n\nThey are not. We have seen explosive price appreciation the last few months, finally hitting the 100k USD benchmark that everyone took for granted as preordained during the last market cycle. That’s not normal.\n\nThe picture on the left is the average feerate each day since 2017, the picture on the right is the average price each day since 2017. When the price was pumping, when it was highly volatile, historically we have seen feerates spike accordingly. Generally matching the growth and peaking when the price did. The people actually buying and selling transacted on-chain, people took custody of their own coins when they bought them.\n\nThis last leg up to over 100k does not seem at all to have had the same proportional affect on feerates that even moves earlier in this cycle have. Now, if you actually did look at both of those charts, I’m sure many people are going “What if this cycle is at the end?” It’s possible, but let’s say it’s not for a second.\n\nWhat else could this be indicating? That the participants that are driving the market are changing. A group of people who used to be dominated by individuals who self custodied, who managed their counterparty risk by removing gains from exchanges, who generated time-sensitive on-chain activity, are transforming into a group of people simply passing around ETF shares that have no need of settling anything on-chain.\n\nThat is not a good thing. Bitcoin’s very nature is defined by the users who interact with the protocol directly. Those who have private keys to authorize transactions generating revenue for miners. Those who are sent funds, and verify transactions against consensus rules with software.\n\nBoth of those things being removed from the hands of users and placed behind the veil of custodians puts the very stability of Bitcoin’s nature at risk.\n\nThis is a serious existential issue that has to be solved. The entire stability of consensus around a specific set of rules is premised on the assumption that there are enough independent actors with separate interests that diverge, but align on a value gained from using that set of rules. The smaller the group of independent actors (and the larger the group of people “using” Bitcoin through those actors as intermediaries) the more practical it is for them to coordinate to fundamentally change them, and the more likely it is that their interests as a group will diverge in sync from the interests of the larger group of secondary users.\n\nIf things continue trending in that direction, Bitcoin very well could end up embodying nothing that those of us here today hope it can. This problem is both a technical one, in terms of scaling Bitcoin in a way that allows users to independently have control of their funds on-chain, even if only through worst-case recourse, but it is also a problem of incentive and risk management.\n\nThe system must not only scale, but it has to be able to provide ways to mitigate the risks of self custody to the degree that people are used to from the traditional financial world. Many of them actually need it.\n\nThis isn’t just a situation of “do the same thing I do because it’s the only correct way,” this is something that has implications for the foundational properties of Bitcoin itself in the long term.\n\nThis article is a Take.

Acquired at an average price of approximately $91,000 per coin, this purchase is a part of the company’s plan to allocate up to $20 million into Bitcoin.\n\n“We are excited to announce these purchases and allocation of Bitcoin as part of our treasury strategy as well as a larger strategic move as we further expand our ties to the crypto industry,” said Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski. “These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies. As a leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community, we are proud to officially hold Bitcoin as we continue to grow and engrain crypto into our company’s DNA.”\n\nThe announcement follows Rumble’s previously disclosed corporate treasury diversification strategy, which was approved by its Board of Directors. The strategy aims to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic asset to accelerate the company’s expansion into digital assets while strengthening its financial position.\n\n“We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly U.S. presidential administration and increased institutional adoption,” Pavlovski stated. “Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. We are also excited to strengthen our ties with crypto and to bolster our efforts to become the leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community.”\n\nThe company noted that the actual timing and value of any future Bitcoin acquisitions will depend on various factors, including general market conditions, Bitcoin’s trading price, and Rumble’s anticipated cash needs. Rumble stated their strategy will remain flexible and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time based on the company’s discretion.\n\nТеги: Bitcoin, Rumble, Treasury Reserve\n"

Private\n\nMax Kei is a builder in the Bitcoin P2P space as well as a seasoned banker, which makes him uniquely qualified to create Debifi, a noncustodial, bitcoin-backed P2P lending platform that primarily serves institutions.\n\nKei’s work in the Bitcoin space began in 2017, when he first contributing to Hodl Hodl, which quickly became a widely used noncustodial P2P trading platform.\n\nIn 2020, he helped the exchange launch Lend at Hodl Hodl, the first noncustodial P2P borrowing and lending product in the Bitcoin space.\n\nThe product gained traction in Latin America and Southeast Asia, where it was used to facilitate microloans, while the likes of Preston Pysh (now Strategic Advisor to Debifi) took interest in the product and renowned cypherpunk Adam Back also sang its praises.\n\nAccording to Kei, it’s the high-quality reputation of the team behind Lend at Hodl Hodl, some of whom now work on Debifi, that’s attracting users to Debifi.\n\n“A lot of lenders and borrowers go to Debifi because they know the team has very extensive experience,” Kei told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n“People are satisfied, as we’ve been through multiple bear cycles and managed to survive,” he added.\n\n“Now, we’ve taken the concept of Lend at Hodl Hodl and moved into the institutional space.”\n\n## From Banker To Bitcoiner\n\nFor 10 years before finding Bitcoin, Kei worked as a private banker.\n\nHe resigned from his position before “going full Bitcoin rabbit hole” at the end of 2015, partially as a reaction to an experience he had with one of his clients.\n\n“A year before I quit, I was sitting in a meeting in the bank office with one of my clients and he was showing me his phone and saying ‘You know at some point in the future, I’m not going to need you because I have bitcoin,’” recounted Kei.\n\nThe client then proceeded to send $15,000 worth of bitcoin to a contact of his in Brazil, according to Kei, who thought to himself that his client was insane. However, it didn’t take long for Kei to realize that his client wasn’t crazy but, instead, onto something.\n\n“I started doing my own research, and I quickly realized that Bitcoin is a real thing,” said Kei.\n\nKei pivoted to Bitcoin soon after. However, after spending eight years building in the Bitcoin space, he’s come to believe that banks will still have a role in a hyperbitcoinized future.\n\n“Banks aren’t going to go away,” explained Kei.\n\n“They will become infrastructure providers for Bitcoin companies, for startups, for everyone. They’re still going to be a backbone,” he added.\n\nHe realized this when banks and other financial institutions began expressing interest in using the Lend at Hodl Hodl product.\n\n## Differentiating With Debifi\n\nWithin months of launching Lend at Hodl Hodl, institutions reached out to the Hodl Hodl team requesting to use the platform.\n\n“They said ‘Hey, we want to be available for bitcoin lending,’” recalled Kei.\n\n“But we didn’t want to mix the world of microlending with the world of institutional lending. We realized we needed to do something different. That’s how the concept of Debifi came into existence,” he added.\n\nIn 2022, Kei began brainstorming Debifi. A year later, they raised money from venture capital firms including Ten31 and Timechain to build a minimum viable product (MVP). By March 2024, Debifi was live.\n\nThe platform has been operating in beta, and the official version will go live at the end of the month. With that said, Kei explained that Debifi is fully functional already.\n\n“Just because the product is in beta doesn’t mean that it’s not operational — it’s actually fully operational,” he said.\n\nAnd so this brings us to the next question: How exactly does Debifi work?\n\n## How Debifi Works\n\nDebifi is both a website and a mobile app, and the two work in tandem.\n\n“We have a very unique value proposition is that the mobile app acts as a key storage,” said Kei. “The mobile app becomes a wallet, storing your private key, but you need to use the website in order to engage in contracts.”\n\nWhen you sign a transaction, create an escrow for a loan, or pay off a loan, you use the mobile app to do so.\n\nUsers can also opt to use the COLDCARD devices (the Mk4 or the Q) in place of the mobile app, and Kei hopes to add support for other hardware wallets as well.\n\n“We want to support Jade from Blockstream, Ledger devices, Trezor devices, the Foundation Passport, and BitBox — all these good names — because we want to provide flexibility for our customers,” explained Kei.\n\nThe collateral for Debifi loans is escrowed in a multisignature (multisig) wallet featuring four keys, three of which are needed to sign off on transactions.\n\n“At Debifi, we have a unique multi-signature setup,” said Kei. “All loans are held in a 3-out-of-4 multsig wallet, while the standard is 2-out-of-3.”\n\nThe borrower, the lender and Debifi each hold one key, while the fourth is held by AnchorWatch. Kei claims that having a fourth key held by a trustworthy institution like AnchorWatch increases security dramatically.\n\n“With two institutions holding keys, even if the lender’s and borrower’s keys are somehow compromised, you still need to get one more key,” said Kei. “If we remove AnchorWatch and go with a simple 2-out-of-3 model, then we might end up in a situation where attackers have two keys and the attacker doesn’t need a third key.”\n\nDebifi loans are overcollateralized (forced liquidations occur if the value of the bitcoin collateral drops below a certain level, which varies based on the agreement between the borrower and lender) and the average APR is just above 10%.\n\nKei explained that his team’s research has shown that many are willing to pay the higher APR for noncustodial loans.\n\n“A while back, we talked with 300 Bitcoiners and we gave them a very simple option: You can borrow custodially at an 8% interest rate or you can borrow noncustodially at 11% or 12% interest rate,” he explained. “91% of people said that they would prefer to hold their keys.”\n\nUsers can take out loans up to $1 million via the platform and the loan durations range from three to 12 months. As of April, this will expand to 24 months.\n\nUsers can borrow in U.S. dollar stablecoins, U.S. dollars, euros, and Swiss francs, and Debifi is working on adding British pounds, Brazilian reals, and Mexican pesos to that list.\n\nDebifi monetizes through origination fees, which it takes from the collateral put in escrow, and it has a dispute resolution team that helps to resolve loan repayment issues and other problems.\n\n## What’s Next For Debifi\n\nAs mentioned, Debifi just brought on Preston Pysh as a strategic advisor in efforts to help the company with networking and publicity. Pysh will also provide advice on how to improve Debifi’s product.\n\nThe company also plans to partner with Blockstream’s Asset Management (BAM) division. BAM will utilize Debifi as a technical provider for institutions looking to offer bitcoin-backed lending products.\n\nBeyond that, Kei noted that a number of other important partnerships are in the pipeline as well, and that Debifi will announce them in the coming months.\n\nAnd he concluded with a pitch to all the institutions out there who might be interested in working with Debifi.\n\n“Debifi helps you plug and play in the bitcoin-backed lending world as an institution,” said Kei.\n\n“We provide you with all the necessary infrastructure. We’ll onboard you, and we’ll guide you with private support. We’ll give you all the necessary tools,” he added.\n\n“Effectively, we’re going to be like a one-stop shop. Not only do you not have to build this stuff because it’s already there, we bring you the customers, which we allow you to communicate with directly. And the best part is that as a liquidity provider, you don’t pay us anything. Zero.”\n\nIt’s hard not to argue that Kei and his team are onto something here.\n\nТеги: Borrowing, Founders, Lending, Multisig, P2P Lending\n"

If elected, Bei would be the first openly pro-bitcoin voice on the 13-member board.\n\nBei is a 16-year veteran firefighter who founded Proof of Workforce, a nonprofit providing bitcoin education to workers, unions and pension funds. He previously served on Santa Monica’s pension advisory board and played a key role in the city’s firefighters union, becoming one of the first to hold bitcoin.\n\nThrough his outreach work, Bei has assisted multiple unions, associations and pensions in exploring and adopting bitcoin strategies. This includes spearheading education efforts for the Wisconsin Retirement System.\n\nHe stated, “Now more than ever, pension participants and stakeholders need to engage with with their pension funds. I am running for the CalPERS Board of Trustees with the goal of being a conduit for engagement and transparency, while advocating for the long term health and success of the nation’s largest pension fund.”\n\nHe received endorsements from a wide range of supporters including the California State Senator Ben Allen, Tony Vazquez of the California Board of Equalization, Santa Monica Mayor Lana Negrete, Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim, President of the Santa Monica Firefighters Local 1109 Garrett Childers and others. This diverse coalition demonstrates the broad appeal of Bei’s message and qualifications.\n\nCalPERS faces growing headwinds with its traditional 60/40 portfolio allocation, struggling amid inflation and rising interest rates. With ballots going out in late August, Bei’s bitcoin credentials could resonate with California’s public workforce seeking new strategies to shore up their retirement security.\n\nHis campaign website accepts donations in both fiat and bitcoin.\n\nТеги: Bitcoin, Pension Fund, Proof Of Workforce\n"

However, many of the speakers acknowledged that Bitcoin is something that will benefit the whole world, and that, partially because of this, the U.S. should lead the way in adoption.\n\nDavid Zell, Director of BPI, set the tone for the event in his opening remarks.\n\n“Our goal for today is to continue this process, to help people understand how Bitcoin benefits America — and the world writ large,” he declared.\n\nZell was followed by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a long-time Bitcoin advocate, who made the case that it’s only natural for America to set the pace when it comes to Bitcoin adoption.\n\n“This really is freedom money,” said Senator Lummis. “And America should lead when it comes to freedom money.”\n\n## Michael Saylor: Bitcoin And American Digital Supremacy\n\nStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor agreed with the Senator, making the case for why the U.S. should lead in this arena.\n\n“I’m here today to show you how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve represents a strategy for United States digital supremacy in the 21st century,” he began.\n\nHe went on to argue in favor of bitcoin as digital property, asserting that the United States should acquire as much of it as possible so that it can “rent and finance” on top of that property.\n\nHe also posited that trillions of dollars in commerce will flow over the Bitcoin network, which is another reason why the U.S. should prioritize acquiring its share of the network.\n\nMoreover, he asserted that Bitcoin embodies American values and that owning it is the next best thing to living in the U.S.\n\n“Everybody who is living in Asia, in Africa would move to the U.S. if they could,” said Saylor.\n\n“They’d move their money to the U.S. if they could. They want the currency of the U.S. They want the security of the U.S. They want the values of the U.S., but they can’t have it,” he added.\n\n“So, the second best thing they can have is to move their money into the Bitcoin network, which has all of the values, protection, and security of the U.S.”\n\n## Vivek Ramaswamy: Bitcoin’s Long-Term Return Is The New High-Risk Hurdle Rate\n\nOhio gubernatorial candidate and American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy followed Saylor, putting forward the motion that the rate of return on holding bitcoin for a decade or more is now the new high-risk hurdle rate.\n\nHe set the stage for this claim by making the case that we’re moving back into an “era of scarce capital.” He shared that this will be the inverse of the past 15 years, during which the Fed printed money en masse, in a manner similar to a cocaine dealer doling out cocaine to hungry users, as he put it.\n\nHe explained that institutions are going to once again have to consider the question “What is my opportunity cost of capital?” and, in doing so, they’ll have to define a hurdle rate for both low- and high-risk investments.\n\nRamaswamy argued that the hurdle rate for low-risk investments is the 10-year U.S. Treasury, while the hurdle rate for a high-risk investment will be the rate of return on bitcoin over a 10-to-15-year period.\n\nHe then closed out his talk by pointing out how the American ethos and the Bitcoin ethos overlap, and that, like the American flag, Bitcoin is a symbol of hope.\n\n“I think Bitcoin and what it represents, more than as a financial asset, also helps to fill that hunger for a symbol, a reminder of what American greatness was all about,” said Ramaswamy. “And I think it makes it, in the national context, an even more fitting asset to fill our national Strategic Reserve.”\n\n## Matthew Pines: The World Is Paying Attention To Bitcoin After SBR EO\n\nMatthew Pines, Executive Director of BPI, pointed out that bitcoin is beginning to take center stage in the eyes of world leaders for two reasons.\n\nThe first, he claimed, is because U.S. debt markets have become increasingly fragile, prompting global leaders to start looking to invest in a global reserve asset aside from U.S. Treasuries.\n\nThe second reason is that President Trump’s SBR EO clearly stated that the United States sees bitcoin as “digital gold,” and that it will only be a matter of time before other leaders view it as the same.\n\n“Last Thursday’s executive order landed on the desk of every major president, central bank [chair] and finance minister in the world,” said Pines.\n\n“There are now discussions happening about how to interpret that. What does that mean for their own country’s relationship to bitcoin? Governments don’t move too fast, but when they do, they move in size, they move in scale and they can deploy trillions of dollars in capital that can have geopolitical effects,” he added.\n\n“And I think we’re at this inflection point where the geopolitical aspects of bitcoin start to become extremely important, and can shape the next several years of Bitcoin’s future. The Bitcoin race is now on, and the ball is in our court to maintain our advantage.”\n\n## Congressman Nick Begich Reintroduces The Bitcoin Act\n\nAfter Pines concluded his talk, he introduced Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK) to the stage, where the Congressman made a major announcement.\n\n“Today, I will be announcing the Bitcoin Act of 2025 in the United States House,” said Rep.  Begich.\n\nThe bill, which is an updated version of the bill Sen. Lummis proposed last year, proposes that the U.S. acquire 1 million bitcoin (at no expense to taxpayers) and protects U.S. citizens’ right to self-custody to their bitcoin.\n\n“[The bill] explicitly protects the rights of individuals to own, hold and transact with bitcoin freely,” said Rep. Begich. “It recognizes self-custody as a fundamental right.”\n\n## Congressman Ro Khanna: Democrats Should Support Bitcoin\n\nAfter a brief talk from Zack Shapiro, Head of Policy at BPI, on why U.S. states should hold bitcoin in their reserves, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) made the case for why Democrats should embrace Bitcoin.\n\n“Bitcoin should be bipartisan,” said Rep. Khanna, the only Democratic politician to speak at the event.\n\n“Now, people are going to be able to get bitcoin. That is transformational for so many people around the world, and that is why the Democratic Party should be embracing this as something that can create financial empowerment for people not just in the United States, but around the world,” he added.\n\n## Jack Mallers: Bitcoin Is A Return To American Values\n\nAfter a handful of talks and panels including the likes of Casa CEO Nick Neuman, Newmarket Capital CEO Andrew Hohns and Lightspark CSO Christian Catalini, Strike CEO Jack Mallers took the stage as the final speaker of the summit.\n\nIn his talk, entitled “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: The American Monetary Revolution”, Mallers made the case that the establishment of the SBR was “a return to American values — including life, liberty and property.”\n\n“The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order and the Bitcoin Act proposed by Senator Lummis is the most significant economic shift and announcement and the only positive economic announcement that’s come out of this nation’s capitol in the last 100 years,” said Mallers.\n\nHe went on to say that American economic policy has been working against the principles the country was founded on and cited Executive Order 6102 (gold confiscation under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933), the Nixon Shock (President Nixon’s depegging the U.S. dollar from gold in 1971) and the 2008 bank bailouts as evidence.\n\nHowever, he ended on a high note.\n\n“[This is a] pivotal moment in American history and a turning point in economic policy for this country,” said Mallers. “The story of humanity is [people] engineering a better world — that’s America, that’s Bitcoin.”\n\nТеги: Bitcoin Policy, Bitcoin Policy Institute, Events, Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, washington dc\n"

And we have several other additional cosponsors. And a lot of it is a result of the excitement that’s been building.”\n\n“So far cosponsors are [Tommy] Tubberville, [Marsha] Blackburn, [Roger] Marshall, [Bernie] Moreno, and [Jim] Justice,” Lummis continued. “We have a couple more feelers out for original cosponsors today but, the House as well through Nick Begich, has six original consponsors.”\n\nComplimentary to Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin act in the Senate, U.S. Congressman Nick Begich announced he will also be introducing the Bitcoin reserve legislation in the House today.\n\n“Today, I will be introducing the Bitcoin Act of 2025 in the United States House,” Congressman Begich said. “This is a bold and forward looking legislative initiative designed to ensure the United States secures its financial independence and maintains its leadership in the global digital economy.”\n\n“The momentum is in our hands and we need to make this happen. Thankfully, President Trump is with us and the opportunities are boundless,” Lummis concluded.\n\nJust last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a federal strategic Bitcoin reserve. The reserve is to be made up of confiscated bitcoin by the federal government from hacks and seizures, creating an estimated reserve of about 200,000 BTC, pending an official audit. However, this reserve, as it stands, has the potential to be overturned by future presidential administrations. Legislation like the Bitcoin Act of 2025 would solve this potential issue as it would see the United States purchase 200,000 bitcoin per year until it has bought a total of 1,000,000 BTC — to be held for a minimum of 20 years.\n\n$115 billion asset manager VanEck claims that this strategic bitcoin reserve “could help offset national debt”, stating that “if the U.S. government follows the BITCOIN Act’s proposed path – accumulating 1 million BTC by 2029 – our analysis suggests this reserve could offset around $21 trillion of national debt by 2049.”\n\nТеги: Bitcoin Policy Institute, bitcoin strategic reserve, cynthia lummis\n"

Anchorage Digital and Copper will use their industry-leading security solutions to custody and safeguard client assets.\n\n“We are thrilled to partner with Anchorage Digital and Copper, whose industry-leading security solutions will help us deliver best-in-class digital asset custody services to our clients,” said Michael Cunningham, Head of Bitcoin Financing at Cantor Fitzgerald. “We are launching with $2 billion in initial financing and expect to substantially grow the operation over time.”\n\nWith Cantor Fitzgerald’s $2 billion initial investment in Bitcoin financing, this partnership signals a major step in mainstream financial institutions embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate investment class.\n\nNathan McCauley, CEO and Co-Founder of Anchorage Digital, added: “Our partnership marks a major step forward for the Bitcoin financing ecosystem—built on the safety and security of federally regulated digital asset custody. By combining the best of traditional finance with the best of crypto, we are expanding the horizon of what is possible for institutions in Bitcoin.”\n\nThis partnership comes as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to advance pro-Bitcoin policies, including the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and reversing previous regulatory hostility under Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which had previously blocked banks from offering Bitcoin custody services. Following this, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) clarified that banks are now permitted to engage in Bitcoin and crypto services, including asset custody. This shift helped paved the way for major financial institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald to expand into Bitcoin services.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald President Howard Lutnick, who now serves as the United States Secretary of Commerce, has been instrumental in this shift. Lutnick has been working closely with President Trump on initiatives such as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a key component of the administration’s crypto strategy.\n\n“Institutional investors are increasingly looking to diversify their portfolios and identify secure routes into the digital asset market,” said Amar Kuchinad, CEO of Copper. “This significant partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald will meet the growing demand for sophisticated financing solutions, with Copper.co’s lending and collateral management platform providing a complete toolkit for secure and strategic asset handling.”\n\nТеги: Bitcoin, Cantor Fitzgerald, finance\n"

The milestone demonstrates Lightning's potential to enable scalable, efficient payments.\n\nАвтор: Vivek Sen Bitcoin | Дата: March 11, 2025\n\nКатегории: NEWS\n\nBitcoin mining pool Braiins has reached a major milestone by processing over 1,000 daily payouts on the Lightning Network. This achievement demonstrates the potential for Lightning to enable instant, low-cost transactions at scale for the mining sector.\n\nSince first introducing Lightning payouts in February 2024 through a partnership with payments platform Voltage, Braiins has experienced consistent double-digit monthly growth in Lightning transactions. Miners now have access to immediate payouts of their earnings rather than relying on slower, expensive on-chain settlement.\n\nAccording to Braiins CEO Eli Nagar, “Lightning payouts have completely changed the way miners receive their earnings. Rather than waiting for on-chain transactions, our miners are now getting instant, frictionless payouts every single day.”\n\nBraiins has averaged nearly 20% month-over-month increase in Lightning payout volumes from mid-2024 into early 2025. The ease and efficiency of instant payouts have been enthusiastically received, especially by small and medium-sized mining operators needing quicker access to capital.\n\nWith over 1,000 daily payouts reached, Braiins has cemented itself as an innovator in mining technologies. Voltage CEO Graham Krizek stated, “This milestone demonstrates how Lightning enables real-world, high-volume transactions at an unprecedented scale.”\n\nAs more pools adopt Lightning for payouts, the broader bitcoin ecosystem stands to benefit through reduced congestion, lower transaction fees, and faster settlement times.\n\nWith Lightning adoption accelerating, the future looks bright for a more seamless and efficient financial infrastructure supporting bitcoin miners globally.\n\nТеги: Bitcoin Lightning, Bitcoin mining, Mining\n"
