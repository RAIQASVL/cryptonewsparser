    "full_content": "# Is Bitcoin’s Bull Market Truly Back?\n\nBitcoin rebounded from $76K—NUPL, Hash Ribbons, and LTH supply suggest the bull market’s back. But is it for real?\n\nAuthor: Matt Crosby | Date: March 28, 2025\n\nCategories: MARKETS, VIDEOS\n\nFollowing a sharp multi-week selloff that dragged Bitcoin from above $100,000 to below $80,000, the recent price bounce has traders debating whether the Bitcoin bull market is truly back on track or if this is merely a bear market rally before the next macro leg higher.\n\n### Bitcoin’s Local Bottom or Bull Market Pause?\n\nBitcoin’s latest correction was deep enough to rattle confidence, but shallow enough to maintain macro trend structure. Price seems to have set a local bottom between $76K–$77K, and several reliable metrics are beginning to solidify the local lows and point towards further upside.\n\nThe Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) is one of the most reliable sentiment gauges across Bitcoin cycles. As price fell, NUPL dropped into “Anxiety” territory, but following the rebound, NUPL has now reclaimed the “Belief” zone, a critical sentiment transition historically seen at macro higher lows.\n\nThe Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple weighs BTC spending by both coin age and transaction size, and compares the data to a previous yearly average, giving insight into long term holder behavior. Current readings have reset to low levels, suggesting that large, aged coins are not being moved. This is a clear signal of conviction from smart money. Similar dynamics preceded major price rallies in both the 2016/17 and 2020/21 bull cycles.\n\n### Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Boost Bull Market\n\nWe’re also now seeing the Long Term Holder Supply beginning to climb. After profit-taking above $100K, long-term participants are now re-accumulating at lower levels. Historically, these phases of accumulation have set the foundation for supply squeezes and subsequent parabolic price action.\n\n### Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Signal Bull Market Cross\n\nThe Hash Ribbons Indicator has just completed a bullish crossover, where the short-term hash rate trend moves above the longer-term average. This signal has historically aligned with bottoms and trend reversals. Given that miner behavior tends to reflect profitability expectations, this cross suggests miners are now confident in higher prices ahead.\n\n### Bitcoin Bull Market Tied to Stocks\n\nDespite bullish on-chain data, Bitcoin remains closely tied to macro liquidity trends and equity markets, particularly the S&P 500. As long as that correlation holds, BTC will be partially at the mercy of global monetary policy, risk sentiment, and liquidity flows. While rate cut expectations have helped risk assets bounce, any sharp reversal could cause renewed choppiness for Bitcoin.\n\n## Bitcoin Bull Market Outlook\n\nFrom a data-driven perspective, Bitcoin looks increasingly well-positioned for a sustained continuation of its bull cycle. On-chain metrics paint a compelling picture of resilience for the Bitcoin bull market. The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) has shifted from “Anxiety” during the dip to the “Belief” zone after the rebound—a transition often seen at macro higher lows. Similarly, the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple has reset to levels signaling conviction among long-term holders, echoing patterns before Bitcoin’s rallies in 2016/17 and 2020/21. These metrics point to structural strength, bolstered by long-term holders aggressively accumulating supply below $80,000.\n\nFurther supporting this, the Hash Ribbons indicator’s recent bullish crossover reflects growing miner confidence in Bitcoin’s profitability, a reliable sign of trend reversals historically. This accumulation phase suggests the Bitcoin bull market may be gearing up for a supply squeeze, a dynamic that has fueled parabolic moves before. The data collectively highlights resilience, not weakness, as long-term holders seize the dip as an opportunity. Yet, this strength hinges on more than just on-chain signals—external factors will play a critical role in what comes next.\n\nHowever, macro conditions still warrant caution, as the Bitcoin bull market doesn’t operate in isolation. Bull markets take time to build momentum, often needing steady accumulation and favorable conditions to ignite the next leg higher. While the local bottom between $76K–$77K seems to hold, the path forward won’t likely feature vertical candles of peak euphoria yet. Bitcoin’s tie to the S&P 500 and global liquidity trends means volatility could emerge from shifts in monetary policy or risk sentiment.\n\nFor example, while rate cut expectations have lifted risk assets, an abrupt reversal—perhaps from inflation spikes or geopolitical shocks—could test Bitcoin’s stability. Thus, even with on-chain data signaling a robust setup, the next phase of the Bitcoin bull market will likely unfold in measured steps. Traders anticipating a return to six-figure prices will need patience as the market builds its foundation.\n\nIf you’re interested in more in-depth analysis and real-time data, consider checking out Bitcoin Magazine Pro for valuable insights into the Bitcoin market.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

    "full_content": "# How to Measure the Success of a Bitcoin Treasury Company\n\nA new playbook for evaluating a Bitcoin Treasury Company—using purpose-built KPIs that go beyond traditional finance to measure Bitcoin-first strategy.\n\nAuthor: Nick Ward | Date: March 28, 2025\n\nCategories: BITCOIN FOR CORPORATIONS\n\nIn the world of traditional finance, evaluating a company’s success usually means tracking revenue growth, earnings per share, or return on equity. But what happens when the core of a company’s strategy isn’t selling products or services, but accumulating Bitcoin?\n\nThat’s the question facing a new class of Bitcoin treasury companies. These are publicly traded firms whose central mission is to acquire and hold Bitcoin over the long term. And to understand whether they’re succeeding, we need a fresh set of tools.\n\nThis article introduces those tools—new key performance indicators (KPIs) designed to evaluate how well a company is executing its Bitcoin strategy. Many of these indicators have been pioneered by Michael Saylor and his company, Strategy, where they can be seen implemented on their new dashboard. These new metrics may sound complex at first, but once broken down, they offer powerful insight into whether a Bitcoin treasury company is truly delivering for its shareholders.\n\n## 1. BTC Yield: Measuring Accretion, Not Earnings\n\nWhat it is: BTC Yield tracks the percentage change over time in the ratio between a company’s Bitcoin holdings and its fully diluted share count. In simple terms: how much more Bitcoin is owned per potential share of stock.\n\nWhy it matters: This KPI is designed to answer a unique question: Is the company acquiring Bitcoin in a way that benefits shareholders?\n\nLet’s say a company holds 10,000 BTC and has 100 million diluted shares. That’s 0.1 BTC per share. If, a year later, it holds 12,000 BTC and has 105 million shares, it now holds ~0.114 BTC per share—a 14% increase. That 14% is your BTC Yield.\n\nWhat makes it unique: BTC Yield doesn’t care about profit margins or EBITDA. It’s focused on how effectively the company is increasing Bitcoin ownership relative to the number of shares that could exist. This is key in a strategy that involves using equity to buy BTC. If management is printing new shares to buy Bitcoin, shareholders want to know: is the Bitcoin per share going up or down?\n\nHow to use it: Investors can track BTC Yield over time to see if dilution (more shares) is being offset by accretive Bitcoin purchases (more BTC). A consistently rising BTC Yield suggests management is executing well.\n\n## 2. BTC Gain: The Bitcoin-Based Growth Metric\n\nWhat it is: BTC Gain takes the BTC Yield and applies it to the company’s starting Bitcoin balance for a period. It tells you how many theoretical “extra” bitcoins the company effectively added through accretive behavior.\n\nWhy it matters: This is a way of visualizing BTC Yield not as a percentage, but as Bitcoin itself. If BTC Yield for the quarter is 5% and the company started with 10,000 BTC, BTC Gain is 500 BTC.\n\nWhat makes it unique: It helps you think in Bitcoin terms, which aligns with the company’s long-term goal. Shareholders aren’t just watching for more BTC—they want more BTC per share. BTC Gain helps quantify how much more BTC the company would’ve had if it started from scratch and grew holdings accretively.\n\nHow to use it: BTC Gain is especially helpful when comparing different time periods. If one quarter shows 200 BTC Gain and the next shows 800 BTC Gain, you know the company’s Bitcoin strategy had a much stronger impact in the second period—even if the BTC price stayed flat.\n\n## 3. BTC $ Gain: Bringing Bitcoin Gains Into Dollar Terms\n\nWhat it is: BTC $ Gain translates BTC Gain into U.S. dollars by multiplying it by the price of Bitcoin at the end of the period.\n\nWhy it matters: Investors still live in a world dominated by fiat. Converting Bitcoin-based growth into dollar terms helps bridge the communication gap between Bitcoin-native strategy and traditional shareholder expectations.\n\nWhat makes it unique: This metric offers a hybrid lens—Bitcoin-denominated growth, viewed in fiat terms. But here’s the catch: BTC $ Gain can show a positive number even if the actual value of the company’s holdings dropped (because the metric is based on share-adjusted accumulation, not fair market value accounting).\n\nHow to use it: Use this metric to contextualize how much value (in dollars) the company’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy may have created over a period—just remember that it’s not a profit measure. It’s a reflection of growth in stake, not accounting gain or loss.\n\n## 4. Bitcoin NAV: A Snapshot of Raw Bitcoin Holdings\n\nWhat it is: Bitcoin NAV (Net Asset Value) is the market value of the company’s Bitcoin holdings. It’s calculated simply: Bitcoin Price × Bitcoin Count.\n\nWhy it matters: It gives a snapshot of the company’s Bitcoin “war chest,” plain and simple.\n\nWhat makes it unique: Unlike traditional NAV used in mutual funds or ETFs, this version ignores liabilities like debt or preferred stock. It’s not meant to tell you what shareholders would get in a liquidation. Instead, it’s just: How much Bitcoin does the company own, and what is it worth right now?\n\nHow to use it: Use Bitcoin NAV to understand the scale of the company’s Bitcoin strategy. A rising NAV could reflect more Bitcoin, higher prices, or both. But remember: it’s not adjusted for debt or financial obligations, so it’s not a full picture of shareholder value.\n\n## 5. BTC Rating: The Leverage Check You Don’t Have to Guess About\n\nWhat it is: BTC Rating is a simple ratio: the market value of the company’s Bitcoin divided by its total financial obligations. It shows how much of the company’s debt and liabilities could be covered by its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nWhy it matters: This metric gives a Bitcoin-native snapshot of balance sheet strength. It helps investors quickly gauge whether a company’s Bitcoin strategy is supported by a sound capital structure—or weighed down by obligations.\n\nWhat makes it unique: Unlike traditional credit ratings that rely on opaque models and institutional trust, BTC Rating is transparent and verifiable. The inputs—Bitcoin holdings and liabilities—are public. It puts solvency into plain sight, without needing anyone’s permission or opinion.\n\nHow to use it: A BTC Rating above 1.0 suggests the company’s Bitcoin position outweighs its obligations—a strong indicator of strategic flexibility and solvency. A rating below 1.0 may signal over-leverage or exposure to refinancing risk. Watching how this ratio evolves over time gives investors a powerful lens for evaluating whether the company’s Bitcoin-first strategy is being executed responsibly.\n\n## Why These Metrics Matter Together\n\nEach KPI gives a different lens:\n\n- BTC Yield shows shareholder-accretive growth.\n- BTC Gain translates that into BTC terms.\n- BTC $ Gain puts it in dollars.\n- Bitcoin NAV shows raw Bitcoin value.\n- BTC Rating tests how that value stacks up against liabilities.\n\nUsed together, they give investors a comprehensive picture of whether a Bitcoin treasury company is:\n\n- Growing its stake effectively\n- Protecting or enhancing shareholder value\n- Managing risk appropriately\n\n## One Final Note: These Metrics Aren’t Perfect\n\nThese KPIs are not traditional financial metrics, and they aren’t meant to be. They ignore things like operating revenue, cash flow, or even debt service costs. They also assume that convertible debt will convert, not mature.\n\nIn other words, they’re tools designed to isolate the Bitcoin strategy, not the whole business. That’s why they should be used alongside a company’s financial statements—not as a substitute.\n\nBut for investors trying to understand whether a company is making smart moves in the Bitcoin arena, these metrics offer something traditional tools can’t: clarity on whether management is using equity and capital in a way that actually grows Bitcoin per share.\n\nAnd in a Bitcoin-first world, that just might be the most important metric of all.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations. This article is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation to acquire, purchase, or subscribe for securities.\n\nTags: Bitcoin, Bitcoin For Corporations, bitcoin treasury company, btc rating, btc yield, Corporate Bitcoin Strategy\n",

Gabe Amo issued a press release stating that Rep. Amo and Rep. Kim (R-CA) reintroduced a bipartisan resolution supporting the use of distributive ledger technologies (DLT), including blockchain, to “support democratic governance, human rights, freedom of information, transparency, and innovation around the world.”\n\nThe resolution (the full text of which was not linked to in the press release) urges federal agencies to explore and support DLT and expresses Congress’ commitment to advancing responsible innovation on this technological front.\n\nRep. Kim commented on the importance of this technology in the press release.\n\n“U.S. leadership in emerging technologies like blockchain not only improves Americans’ lives but also helps us advance transparency in U.S. foreign assistance, human rights, and freedom across the globe,” said Rep. Kim.\n\n“This legislation is vital, especially as we see the Chinese Communist Party exporting its surveillance technologies and authoritarianism abroad. I am proud to join Congressman Amo to lead this bipartisan resolution to ensure the United States shines as a beacon of hope, freedom, and innovation on the world stage,” she added.\n\nThe press release also cited how, in Screven County, Georgia, the Bitcoin blockchain was used to safeguard election election results and provide transparency to voters, linking to this article, which tells the story of the event.\n\nSimple Proof, the company that helped Screven County officials commit its vote tallies to the immutable Bitcoin blockchain also recently helped Republicans in Williamson County, Tennessee do the same with the results of its Republican leadership vote.\n\nSimple Proof put itself on the map when it helped to secure the results of the most recent presidential election in Guatemala, the story of which is told in the short documentary Immutable Democracy. Thanks to the vote tallies from the election being safeguarded on the Bitcoin blockchain, the integrity of the election was upheld, despite efforts made to tamper with physical votes once voting had concluded.\n\nThe work that the company has done both in the U.S. and abroad is a testament to a point Rep. Amo made in the press release.\n\n“Innovative technology like blockchain helps promote transparency and strengthen democratic institutions around the world,” said the congressman.\n\nWhile the press release provided evidence of the Bitcoin blockchain being used to preserve democratic values, it didn’t differentiate between Bitcoin and other blockchains, many of which, by design, are less secure.\n\nTags: Bitcoin Policy, Democracy, Legislation, u.s. congress, Voting\n",

    "full_content": "# Hardware Wallets: Bitcoin’s Biggest Adoption Barrier\n\nBitcoin hardware wallets have a lot of catching up to do in order to support Bitcoin's growing functionality.\n\nAuthor: Zach Herbert | Date: March 27, 2025\n\nCategories: TECHNICAL, FEATURED\n\nThere are roughly half a billion crypto users around the world and, at the most generous estimate, only 2.5% are using hardware wallets. That’s a tiny number, but I’m relieved it’s not higher.\n\nWhy? Because I want people to on-board to Bitcoin by the billion, and I want to see everyone self-custody securely. The consumer hardware wallet industry is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving this goal. And not just to Bitcoin adoption: the whole decentralization revolution is at risk if we don’t address the fatal flaw  at the heart of the world’s most popular wallets.\n\n## Wallets are treading water\n\nLast year in these pages, Lucien Bourdon celebrated “10 years of the wallet revolution”. There’s a lot I agree with, but one glaring omission. Almost without exception, the ‘leading’ consumer hardware wallets on the market today have barely innovated in a decade. And as every security expert knows, if you’re not constantly advancing, you’re moving backwards.\n\nThe problem isn’t simply that new threats are constantly emerging, it’s that Bitcoin use cases are rapidly evolving. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are no longer ‘just’ stores of value; they are now a medium for all kinds of increasingly complex transactions. Yet hardware wallets’ underlying technology is essentially unchanged from the days when their primary utility was as a secure, offline keysafe. It’s the same with UX, with users still expected to write down their seed words and then squint at a tiny screen every time they want to approve a transaction.\n\nThis isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The future of security will see everyone safeguarding our most valuable digital assets and sensitive data with cryptographic keys. In fact, the whole decentralized economy depends on what’s inside these wallets – so let’s take a peek.\n\n## Trust, Don’t Verify?\n\nLucien was right to stress that Bitcoin’s strength comes from its commitment to open-source principles. Where I profoundly disagree with him is that open-source has been adopted by “most of the wallet industry”.\n\nThe fact is, the leading hardware wallets continue to be built on closed-source, proprietary systems that users cannot fully inspect. If they can’t inspect, they can’t verify; if they can’t verify, why should users take manufacturers’ claims on trust?\n\nI suspect the reason so many hardware wallets remain “black boxes” is because they have something to hide – like the decades-old smart card technology used by so many of the wallets to which bitcoiners entrust their keys. This tech isn’t fit for today’s crypto use cases,  and certainly not for a future of decentralized security, where we’ll need keys to safeguard everything from our digital identities to access credentials.\n\n## A Barrier to Innovation…and Adoption\n\nHardware wallets’ continued reliance on closed, proprietary systems is not just a security nightmare: it’s also terrible for Bitcoin innovation and adoption.\n\nToday’s wallets are effectively  walled gardens, where developers must follow restrictive rules and can’t offer any degree of customization for users. This isn’t just control freakery for its own sake; often, it’s a function of the underlying technology. Devices like Ledger need to give every app access to the master seed; obviously, that means they have to be painstakingly reviewed before they are approved (if they ever are).\n\nIf that’s how the App Store worked, we’d still be carrying Nokia 3310s round in our pockets. Instead, we got open ecosystems, a thriving developer community, competition, and a galaxy of brilliant apps.\n\nThat’s what I wish for wallets. When developers can build permissionlessly, they will not only deliver novel functionality and enhanced user experience, but will play an essential role in wallets’ evolution to support (and secure) the ever-growing complexity of bitcoin applications.\n\nWallets should be a hub of innovation, a place for developers to build the killer apps that will compel people to adopt Bitcoin and blockchain-based services. In reality, an ecosystem like Ledger is the “anti-App Store”, holding back decentralized innovation instead of driving it forward.\n\n## Open Your Wallet\n\nThe solution is both simple and essential: transparency. Just as strong encryption relies on publicly tested, open-source algorithms to ensure security, the devices that store cryptographic keys must follow the same philosophy. Open-source hardware and software enable security researchers, developers, and even individual users to audit and verify security measures, reducing reliance on manufacturers’ claims and increasing overall trustworthiness.\n\nNewer, more secure alternatives already exist. Hardware wallets based on open-source microkernel architectures provide a more robust security foundation, allowing independent verification of their safety. These systems ensure that no single company controls the security of users’ cryptographic keys, reducing the risk of hidden vulnerabilities and fostering innovation.\n\nThe good news is that only one in 40 crypto users currently owns a hardware wallet. Let’s make sure we give the other 39 a truly secure way to self-custody their digital future – and support the innovation that will attract billions more to adopt.\n\nThis is a guest post by Zach Herbert.

This follows the company’s recent decision to update its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.\n\nAuthor: Nik | Date: March 26, 2025\n\nCategories: NEWS, BUSINESS\n\nGameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) announced today that it intends to raise $1.3 billion through a private offering of convertible senior notes and will use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin. The move comes a day after the company revealed an update to its investment policy, allowing Bitcoin to be used as a treasury reserve asset.\n\nThe offering consists of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2030. Additionally, the company plans to grant initial purchasers an option to buy up to $200 million more in notes within a 13-day period from the first issuance date. The notes will be general unsecured obligations and will not bear regular interest or accrete in value. They will mature on April 1, 2030, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased earlier.\n\nUpon conversion, GameStop will have the option to settle in cash, shares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of both. The initial conversion rate and other terms will be determined at the time of pricing. The company stated that it expects to use the U.S. composite volume-weighted average price of its stock from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the pricing date as the reference for the initial conversion price.\n\nGameStop emphasized that neither the notes nor any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion have been or will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws. As a result, they may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption. The company also stated that there are no assurances that the offering will be completed as described or at all.\n\nThis marks a significant financial decision for GameStop as it pivots toward integrating Bitcoin into its corporate strategy. A strategy pioneered by Strategy’s Michael Saylor, who met with GameStop’s CEO Ryan Cohen in person last month, and has definitely appeared to have had an influence on the GameStop’s decision to embrace BTC as a reserve asset.\n\nTags: Bitcoin, Bitcoin For Corporations, gamestop, GME, michael saylor, Ryan Cohen, Strategy\n",

It is not some force of the universe, some natural element or mineral that was “discovered” floating out in the ether. It is a technology. Technologies are created by human beings, not discovered. They are designed. That design has intent, elements of it are made specifically in a way to facilitate that intent. The tolerances of what a technology can or cannot handle are a result of those design decisions, which are in turn a result of the intent.\n\nNew Bitcoiners are being brought into the world of Bitcoin through a lens that obscures and distorts the realities of Bitcoin as a technology and what that entails, and tries to pack it into the box of “digital gold.”\n\nBitcoiners are becoming goldbugs. People who think Bitcoin is some magic thing that is decentralized “just cause,” whose future success is preordained and an absolute certainty.\n\nThis is a disastrous way for people to conceptualize Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a decentralized computer network. The conditions of a network are not a static thing. Environments change, network loads change, behavior of network users change. All of these things can have impacts on the viability and functioning of the network itself.\n\nGold doesn’t need patches for vulnerabilities. Gold doesn’t have to overhaul major subsystems because a change in user behavior overloaded them to the point of not functioning correctly or efficiently. Gold doesn’t need to worry about Denial of Service attack vectors that could disrupt, or worst case bring down, the entire “gold network.”\n\nBitcoin does. Bitcoin is not “digital gold,” it is a decentralized network made of software individuals actually have to run and maintain. The Bitcoin goldbugs have completely lost connection with this reality, at least when it comes to rationally assessing risks to Bitcoin, or ways it genuinely could fail or be co-opted.\n\nBitcoin is going to have problems it needs to solve, at a fundamental technical level. It already does, and it will have more. This is how technology works, it is an inherent part of it. Bitcoin’s value stems from its use as a censorship resistant network, a freedom money no one can stop you from using. That is its core valuable characteristic.\n\nThat characteristic hinges entirely on its decentralized nature.\n\nIf people do not work to defend that decentralized nature, to interact with Bitcoin in a decentralized fashion, to improve and fix it as needed to counteract limitations or pressures encouraging centralization, then it will not remain decentralized.\n\nWe are going to very soon regret the consequences of focusing so much outreach the last few cycles purely on spreading this “digital gold” narrative. This entire generation of Bitcoiners does not fundamentally understand that decentralization isn’t a static unchanging characteristic set in stone forever.\n\nIt needs to be maintained.\n\nThis article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author’s and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nTags: Bitcoiners, goldbugs, Technology\n",

    "full_content": "# GameStop’s Bitcoin Move Looks Bold—But It Might Be Brilliant\n\nGameStop’s Bitcoin move left many scratching their heads. But behind the confusion is a clear, calculated strategy that more CFOs should be watching closely.\n\nAuthor: Nick Ward | Date: March 26, 2025\n\nCategories: BITCOIN FOR CORPORATIONS\n\nThis week, GameStop quietly updated its investment policy to include Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. With approximately $4.78 billion in cash—nearly 37% of its $12.9 billion market cap—this move marks more than just a diversification of reserves.\n\nIt’s a signal that corporate treasury strategy is evolving. That excess cash on the balance sheet can—and perhaps should—be more than idle. And that new asset classes are gaining legitimacy in the boardroom, not just on message boards.\n\nGameStop’s move may not be typical. But it is highly strategic—and increasingly relevant for CFOs evaluating how to preserve capital and unlock value in a shifting macro landscape.\n\n## Why Bitcoin—and Why Now?\n\nFor companies with material cash holdings, the erosion of purchasing power is no longer theoretical—it’s measurable. Over the past decade, the U.S. dollar has declined in real terms by more than 25%, driven by inflation, expansionary monetary policy, and global fiscal uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin presents a compelling counterweight to this degradation, particularly for balance sheets with the flexibility to tolerate mark-to-market volatility in pursuit of long-term strategic payoff.\n\nConsider its defining characteristics:\n\n- Fixed supply: Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, making it the only digital asset engineered to be verifiably scarce in a world of expanding monetary supply.\n- Global liquidity: Bitcoin trades 24/7 in deep global markets, offering CFOs a high-liquidity, non-sovereign asset class accessible without jurisdictional constraints.\n- Resilience to monetary intervention: Bitcoin is not subject to interest rate policy, quantitative easing, or the political whims of central banks.\n- Long-term outperformance: With a 6-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 72.7%, Bitcoin has dramatically outpaced equities, bonds, and real estate over the same period.\n\nFor CFOs thinking in 3, 5, or 10-year increments, the case for allocating even a small portion of excess cash to Bitcoin is no longer fringe—it’s prudent exploration.\n\n## Accounting Clarity Unlocks Strategic Action\n\nUntil recently, many finance teams ruled out Bitcoin simply due to unfavorable accounting treatment. Under legacy GAAP standards, Bitcoin had to be impaired when its price dropped, but could not be revalued when it recovered—an asymmetric model that distorted true economic value and discouraged adoption.\n\nIn late 2024, that barrier was removed.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved new rules that now allow companies to measure Bitcoin at fair market value. Beginning in 2025, companies can:\n\n- Reflect both unrealized gains and losses in earnings\n- Report Bitcoin more transparently in financial statements\n- Align accounting treatment with actual asset performance\n\nThis change addresses one of the most common objections from CFOs and audit committees alike. It brings Bitcoin into compliance with modern reporting standards—making it viable not just for speculation, but for responsible treasury management.\n\n## Why GameStop Was a Natural Fit\n\nEvery company has a unique capital structure, investor base, and operational profile. GameStop’s decision to allocate to Bitcoin wasn’t just bold—it was structurally appropriate.\n\n- High liquidity: With over $4.78 billion in cash and equivalents, GameStop’s balance sheet provides room for allocation without compromising near-term operations.\n- Resilient investor base: GameStop’s shareholders have already demonstrated long-term conviction and a willingness to support unorthodox but calculated strategies.\n- Cultural alignment: As a company that challenged Wall Street norms in 2021, GameStop’s embrace of a decentralized, digital reserve asset aligns with its identity as a financial outlier.\n\nThis doesn’t mean Bitcoin is a fit for every public company. But for those with excess reserves and a forward-looking treasury mindset, it deserves serious consideration.\n\n## The Bigger Picture: What It Means for Other Companies\n\nGameStop’s move is part of a broader rethinking of the traditional treasury reserve model. For decades, companies stored value in cash, short-term bonds, and dollar-denominated equivalents. But in today’s environment, those instruments may preserve nominal value while degrading purchasing power.\n\nBitcoin introduces an alternative—and the macro backdrop is increasingly supportive.\n\n- Ongoing inflation: Despite cooling from its peak, inflation remains persistently above central bank targets, steadily eroding the real value of corporate cash holdings.\n- Elevated debt levels: Sovereign debt across developed nations continues to climb, increasing the likelihood of future currency devaluation and suppressing real yields.\n- ETF-driven validation: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has introduced new channels for institutional participation, signaling broader market legitimacy.\n- Shift in investor expectations: As digital-native generations begin to shape capital markets, shareholder interest in Bitcoin and hard assets is rising—especially among retail and growth-oriented investors.\n\nThese tailwinds create space for CFOs to begin allocating conservatively—without needing to commit to a radical overhaul of reserve strategy.\n\n## A Quiet Signal to the Market\n\nGameStop’s move didn’t come with a flashy press conference or social media fanfare. It came through a formal policy update—exactly how strategic treasury decisions are typically made.\n\nThe signal it sends is simple but important: “We believe excess capital should be protected—and positioned for asymmetric upside.”\n\nBitcoin is not a cure-all. But it is now, for the first time, auditable, liquid, and institutionally viable. For CFOs with flexibility and foresight, exploring Bitcoin is no longer about being first—it’s about preparing for what’s next.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations. This article is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation to acquire, purchase, or subscribe for securities.\n\nTags: Bitcoin, Bitcoin For Corporations, bitcoin treasury, Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, Corporate Bitcoin Strategy, gamestop\n",

    "full_content": "# Congressman Ro Khanna Says Democrats Are Changing Their Tune On Bitcoin\n\nFor years, Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA) has been one of the few Democratic politicians in the U.S. government who's been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, but now he says that more Democratic elected officials as well as prominent voices in the party are coming to support his stance.\n\nAuthor: Frank Corva | Date: March 26, 2025\n\nCategories: POLITICS, FEATURED\n\nOn March 11, 2025, Rep. Ro Khanna gave a short but impactful talk at the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s Bitcoin for America summit.\n\n“Bitcoin is transformational for so many people around the world,” Rep. Khanna stated at the summit. “That is why the Democratic Party should be embracing it as something that can create financial empowerment for people not just in the United States, but around the world.”\n\nThis is the type of message he’s been spreading for years now, and he’s urged his fellow Democrats to follow his lead. He’s implored them to not be scared of Bitcoin but to view it just as they view other major technological advancements of our time, including the internet itself.\n\n“My goal is to make Bitcoin bipartisan,” Rep. Khanna told Bitcoin Magazine. “I want to convince Democrats that bitcoin is a next-generation store of value that millions of people around the world use and that America showing leadership on it allows us to connect with these people, often some of the most disenfranchised.”\n\nFor a party that often advocates for financial inclusion, it seems almost ironic that so many Democrats have looked past Bitcoin, an open-source technology that anyone can use with nothing more than an internet connection (and, in some cases, even without one).\n\nWith that said, Rep. Khanna made the point that, while he remains one of the few more vocal Democrats when it comes to being pro-Bitcoin, the number of Democratic politicians who have stated that they’re in favor of the technology has increased substantially over the past few years.\n\n“We went from just 10 of us or so supporting Bitcoin and crypto to almost 70 or 80,” said Rep. Khanna. “It’s happening slowly.”\n\nAnd while some have attributed to malice most Democrats’ historical stance on Bitcoin, Rep. Khanna claims the issue is more a lack of understanding of the technology’s purpose and use cases.\n\n“Some Democratic politicians are not aware of how helpful Bitcoin can be with remittances or how it can be used by those who don’t have access to U.S. dollars,” said the congressman. “Many people around the world use it for both reasons,” he added, alluding to the idea that many, including some Democrats, might not be aware of this fact.\n\n## The Bitcoin And Crypto Voting Bloc In U.S. Swing States\n\nAccording to research from Coinbase, in each of the swing states in the most recent U.S. presidential election, there were about 10 times the number of crypto holders compared to the vote differential between Biden and Trump in 2020.\n\nHarris lost to Trump in each of these swing states, leaving some to speculate that the turnout of the Bitcoin and crypto voting bloc may have been one of the primary forces that swayed the election in Trump’s favor.\n\nWhile Rep. Khanna doesn’t know to what extent this voting bloc impacted the election results, he agreed that it was likely one of many major factors that affected the outcome of the election.\n\n“I think it made a difference,” said the congressman. “In such a close election, everything matters, and the fact that there were some Democrats who offended Bitcoin and crypto voters was not helpful.”\n\nAnd Rep. Khanna is not alone in acknowledging this.\n\nIn December 2024, at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Van Jones — political analyst, media persona, and prominent voice within the Democratic party — stated that it was to the Democratic party’s detriment that it shut out pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto voters.\n\nRep. Khanna sang Jones’ praises and said that we should be hearing more voices like Jones’ within the Democratic party speaking up in favor of Bitcoin in the near future.\n\n“I have a lot of respect for Van Jones,” said Rep. Khanna.\n\n“He spent some time in the Bay Area, so he gets technology. The party will be moving in a direction that’s going to embrace Bitcoin and other technologies,” he added.\n\n## Will President Trump’s Embrace Of Bitcoin Deter Democrats From Supporting It?\n\nWhile it only seems logical that the Democratic party would reverse its stance on Bitcoin if it’s looking to pick up seats on the House and Senate come the 2026 midterm elections, it simultaneously seems difficult to imagine more Democrats coming out in support of Bitcoin given the highly partisan political climate in the U.S. coupled with the fact that President Trump is an ardent Bitcoin supporter.\n\nRep. Khanna argued that Democrats shouldn’t be thinking along party lines when it comes to Bitcoin, but rather assessing the technology based solely on what it is.\n\n“Politicians are capable of evaluating Bitcoin on its merits,” said Rep. Khanna.\n\n“Bitcoin is just a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without a need for an intermediary. People just need to study Bitcoin and learn that it’s just a medium of exchange,” he added.\n\nRep. Khanna also took a moment to differentiate between Bitcoin and meme coins, highlighting the fact that the president’s recently released coin ($TRUMP) creates much confusion regarding the value proposition of crypto assets, including bitcoin.\n\n“We shouldn’t have elected officials like President Trump launching meme coins,” said the congressman.\n\n## Getting Democrats on the Right Side of History\n\nAt a time when many U.S. citizens are struggling to make ends meet, should Bitcoin be a front-and-center issue for Democrats, once widely regarded as the political party of the middle and working class?\n\nRep. Khanna doesn’t necessarily think so, but he also doesn’t think the party should continue to pooh-pooh the technology.\n\n“There are far bigger issues at hand right now like the cuts in Medicaid, the firing of veterans, and the erratic policy of tariffs,” the congressman explained.\n\n“But the Democrats were on the wrong side of issues of innovation and Bitcoin in 2022 and 2024, and we now have an opportunity to get on the right side of it,” he added.\n\nSo, how can pro-Bitcoin Democrat voters help to get their party on the right side of history when it comes to Bitcoin?\n\nRep. Khanna had a few suggestions:\n\n“They should point to those of us who are leading on Bitcoin and crypto,” he said.\n\n“They can encourage members of government to study the issue, so that they’re not uninformed,” he added.\n\n“And they should talk about the enormous adoption of Bitcoin.”\n\nTags: Bitcoin, Democrats, Politics, ro khanna, U.S. House of Representatives\n",

You can watch the full video here: Will MicroStrategy Realistically Surpass $1,000 – Data Analysis\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- Strategy’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Over 500,000 BTC\n- Strategy Data Dashboard: A New Tool from Bitcoin Magazine Pro\n- Can Strategy’s MSTR Price Reach $1,000? Data-Backed Scenarios\n- Capital Raises Fuel Future BTC Accumulation\n- MSTR Insights Based on Numbers\n- Strategy vs. Bitcoin: Volatility and Correlation Analysis\n- Limitations: Will Strategy Ever Rival Apple in Market Cap?\n- Conclusion: Strategy’s MSTR Price Outlook is Bullish but Speculative\n\n### Strategy’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Over 500,000 BTC\n\nStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has firmly positioned itself as a Bitcoin-centric company. In less than five years, it has accumulated over 500,000 BTC—accounting for more than 2.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply—turning its stock into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure.\n\n### Strategy Data Dashboard: A New Tool from Bitcoin Magazine Pro\n\nThe video introduces the new Treasury Analytics dashboard on BitcoinMagazinePro.com. This tool provides vital insights into Strategy’s:\n\n- Real-time Bitcoin holdings\n- Net Asset Value (NAV) premiums\n- Stock price data\n- Historical volatility\n\nThis dashboard empowers investors to assess the intrinsic value of MSTR and its correlation to Bitcoin price movements.\n\n### Can Strategy’s MSTR Price Reach $1,000? Data-Backed Scenarios\n\nMatt Crosby walks through multiple valuation models based on the following assumptions:\n\n- Bitcoin price levels at $100K, $150K, and $200K\n- BTC holdings expanding to 700K or even 800K BTC\n- NAV premiums ranging from 2x to 3.5x\n\nUsing these inputs, Crosby outlines realistic Strategy stock price targets between $950 and $2,000. In ultra-bullish scenarios, extreme targets of $15,000 or even $25,000 are modeled, though acknowledged as speculative.\n\n### Capital Raises Fuel Future BTC Accumulation\n\nTo support further Bitcoin acquisition, Strategy is leveraging several financial instruments:\n\n- A $2.1 billion at-the-money stock offering\n- A $711 million perpetual preferred stock issuance\n\nThese capital raises could enable the company to purchase an additional 200K to 300K BTC.\n\n### MSTR Insights Based on Numbers\n\nFor investors closely tracking Strategy (MSTR), the numbers tell a powerful story:\n\n- 500,000+ BTC Accumulated: Strategy now holds over 2.41% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist — making it the go-to public stock for BTC exposure.\n- From $9 to $543: Since 2020, MSTR’s stock has soared from around $9 to over $543 (adjusted for stock splits), thanks largely to its Bitcoin accumulation strategy.\n- Revenue vs. BTC Value: While Strategy pulled in $463 million in software revenue in 2024, its Bitcoin holdings are worth around $43 billion — it would take a century of software sales to match its BTC portfolio.\n- Capital to Buy More BTC: The company is raising $2.1 billion through stock offerings and has already secured $711 million via preferred shares — funding that could add another 200K–300K BTC to its balance sheet.\n- NAV Premiums Matter: At times, MSTR has traded at a 3.4x premium to its net asset value. The current premium is around 1.7x, with room to expand in a bullish market.\n- Higher Volatility Than BTC: MSTR’s price swings are more intense than Bitcoin’s — its 3-month volatility peaked at 7.56%, compared to BTC’s 3.32%.\n- Deeper Drawdowns in Bear Markets: In past down cycles, BTC lost about 80%, but MSTR fell as much as 90%, showing it tends to amplify Bitcoin’s moves.\n\nTogether, these figures highlight both the massive upside potential and the high volatility risk that come with investing in Strategy.\n\n### Strategy vs. Bitcoin: Volatility and Correlation Analysis\n\nCrosby points out that Strategy tends to move even more sharply than Bitcoin. Over the past three months, Bitcoin’s volatility averaged around 3.32%, while MSTR’s volatility reached 7.56% — more than double.\n\nLooking back at bear markets, Bitcoin typically retraced about 80%, but Strategy’s stock fell closer to 90%. This highlights that Strategy doesn’t just follow Bitcoin — it amplifies it. That means bigger gains in bull markets, but also steeper losses during downturns.\n\n### Limitations: Will Strategy Ever Rival Apple in Market Cap?\n\nWhile the numbers might hint at sky-high stock price possibilities, reaching them is another story. For Strategy to seriously compete with tech giants like Apple, it would need to:\n\n- Accumulate between 850,000 and 1 million BTC\n- See Bitcoin’s total market cap rise above gold’s $20 trillion\n- Sustain a net asset value (NAV) premium of 3x to 4x consistently\n\nEven if all that happened, Strategy’s market cap would need to grow by 45 times to match Apple’s $3.3 trillion valuation. That kind of leap is extremely unlikely in this current cycle — it’s more of a long-term, speculative scenario.\n\n### Conclusion: Strategy’s MSTR Price Outlook is Bullish but Speculative\n\nAccording to Matt Crosby’s analysis, Strategy’s MSTR price reaching $1,000 or even $2,000 is entirely within the realm of possibility during this market cycle—provided Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory and investor sentiment remains bullish. These targets are grounded in data models that factor in current BTC holdings, potential future acquisitions, and historical NAV premiums.\n\nHowever, this opportunity doesn’t come without its caveats. Strategy’s stock is known for its heightened volatility—often exceeding that of Bitcoin itself—which makes it a high-beta, high-risk investment vehicle. Investors considering MSTR should be prepared for significant price swings and prolonged drawdowns, particularly during Bitcoin market corrections.\n\nThat said, for long-term Bitcoin believers and those with a higher tolerance for risk, Strategy offers a compelling, leveraged play on the broader crypto market. With its continued accumulation strategy and substantial institutional backing, MSTR remains one of the most data-driven and high-conviction ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s future growth.\n\nAs always, potential investors should do their due diligence, factor in risk management strategies, and align their investments with personal financial goals and time horizons.\n\nIf you’re interested in more in-depth analysis and real-time data, consider checking out Bitcoin Magazine Pro for valuable insights into the Bitcoin market.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Yet the greater Bitcoin community probably has no idea how influential this niche Austin community has become.\n\nAuthor: Juan Galt | Date: March 26, 2025\n\nCategories: BUSINESS, CULTURE, FEATURED, NEWS\n\nBorn in the heart of Texas, PlebLab.dev is a well-known name within the Bitcoin start-up world. And yet, most people who have heard about this niche Bitcoin community in Austin are probably unaware of their wins and influence.Started as a coworking space out of Capital Factory in 2021 by a couple of Bitcoin enthusiasts, PlebLab has grown into a Mecca of the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem in the United States. They host various events and meetups throughout the year and have become a reliable work environment for Bitcoiners, whether living in Austin or just passing through.\n\n“In art school, I had this professor who’d make us stop after an hour of creating, walk around, and give honest feedback on each other’s work—it built a collaborative vibe where we can grow together. That stuck with me,” Car González, CEO of PlebLab, recalls. So when I took over PlebLab, I asked: ‘How do I make it more collaborative? How do I make it more about that, not just coworking?’ When you say coworking, it’s literally just working. How boring is that—working among other people who are also working? That’s not fun.”\n\nYet more than just a “coworking” space, PlebLab has become a “community accelerator for the Bitcoin era” with multiple successful Bitcoin companies and developer celebrities going through it since its inception.\n\n## Genesis\n\nFounded out of the dream to build on Bitcoin and grow a local community, PlebLab got its first office in Capital Factory, a renown tech coworking hub in Austin in 2021. The three cofounders, Car González, Keyan Kousha, and Kyle Murphy started doing Bitcoin meetups that grew to crowds of over 200 people. Among them, various entrepreneurs and Bitcoin developers started to stick around, asking to co-work with them out of Capital Factory.\n\nOver time PlebLab grew into different office locations, currently installed next to the Unchained Capital offices and the Bitcoin Park (Formerly Bitcoin Commons) in downtown Austin (at 6th St. and Congress Ave.). With more space, talent, and experience, PlebLab transformed from a coworking space into a mix between a hacker garage and a start-up incubator.\n\nToday they offer various membership packages, mentorship, and a wealth of resources to start-ups that join them, but this is not a pay-to-play “Bitcoin We-work”: Memberships can be denied depending on the goals and purpose of the project. It’s more akin to a private Bitcoin club for builders and technologists than anything else.\n\n“I really think we’re an accelerator for the Bitcoin era. How you do that in an open source, cypherpunk way is you don’t give somebody 500k on day one and say, ‘You got three months to make it or see you later.’ To me, that sounds like a fiat-era thing,” said Car.\n\n## Main Events\n\nThe main events held by PlebLab are Top Builder and Startup Day. Often taking place within six months of each other.“Top Builder is the Top Chef of Bitcoin. We try to find the latest, greatest builders, pile them in, and get them to build an MVP or something pitchable,” said Car, describing the event which functions like a three-month hackathon, exposing finalists to VCs and angel investors.\n\nStartup Day on the other hand is a short conference that provides a platform for Bitcoin start-ups to present their work, meet talent, and get exposure in the Bitcoin world. In Car’s words it is meant to “inspire people to go from the sidelines to building their own company. They’ll see themselves in those people talking on stage.”\n\n## Judge it by its Fruit\n\nA variety of big names within the Bitcoin start-up world have spent time in PlebLab, Car was very hesitant to take credit for the work of others, and stressed his admiration for the founders and leaders whose journey he has witnessed.\n\n“Seeing their journey go from a person you meet, shake hands with initially, to where they are—seeing the numbers they have, and when they get to a point like base camp, a raise, a pre-seed or seed”, Car said. “That base camp for me is just, ‘Cool, they did it.’ Now, let’s go help somebody else. That’s the thing I love—the shipment of the code, so to speak—We just try to be good stewards of that.”\n\nNevertheless, the track record is impressive. Here’s a quick overview of Bitcoin projects, companies, and developer celebrities closely associated with PlebLab:\n\n### Jippi – Winner of Top Builder 2025\n\nLead by Oliver, Jippi.app is a beautiful and fun Bitcoin app designed with Gen Z in mind. Echoing the success of Pokemon Go, Jippi invites young people to explore their cities in search of Bitcoin Beasts, charming little 3D creatures that hide in augmented reality, waiting for future owners with sats rewards.The app has been in development for over a year and just last week won the first prize in PlebLab’s Top Builder competition among fierce competition. Mind-blowing to the judges and audience alike, Jippi has a live, functioning app, man-on-the-street surveys, and app tests in a local university. As well as a masterful presentation of the rationale and vision for Jippi, the app may have the potential to go viral in the United States — and with it bring a new generation into Bitcoin.\n\n### Stacker.news\n\nStarted in 2021 by one of PlebLab’s cofounders Keyan Kousha, Stacker.news has quickly become a hub of news for many tech-savvy Bitcoiners. Boasting an open source Lightning-powered Reddit, the platform has gathered an active and loyal fan base that reward each other with sats for every upvote, often being early to integrate the latest technologies in the Bitcoin-social media tech scene.\n\n### Zaprite\n\nStarted at the end of 2021 by John Magill, Zaprite has quickly grown into a full payment gateway suite for businesses, supporting both Bitcoin and Lightning payment rails as well as event ticketing and all the accounting and invoicing tools necessary for a modern merchant.\n\nZaprite made recent history by being the interface Donald J. Trump used to pay for a burger with bitcoin at the Bitcoin Pub Pub Key in New York.\n\n### Mutiny Wallet\n\nLaunched in early 2023 and led by celebrity Bitcoin developers Ben Carman and Tony Giorgio, Mutiny Wallet quickly gained popularity among Lightning power users as a fully featured and innovative Bitcoin app. It consistently integrated cutting-edge payments technology like e-cash-denominated payments and Nostr integration, while rocking its signature red-and-black color scheme.Following the arrest of Samourai Wallet developers and the consequent chilling effect on Bitcoin self-custody wallet development, Mutiny Wallet announced it would be sunsetting the project, nevertheless demonstrating incredible technical ability and leaving behind a sophisticated set of open source software tools for the Lighting, Nostr, and e-cash ecosystem.\n\n### Nifty (Bitcoin++)\n\nAs a Bitcoin and Lightning developer, Nifty became famous for her developer education efforts via Base 58, her world-renowned developer events called Bitcoin++, her relentless work ethic, impressive travel schedule, and of course her charm, bringing together Bitcoin developer communities all over the world, multiple times a year.Nifty has quickly become a recognized and influential figure in the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem, including a seat on the board of directors of Opensats, a public charity focused on funding open source Bitcoin projects of all types, with a special focus on Nostr – the Bitcoin native social media protocol. In her journey to stardom, she spent significant time at PlebLab, and is still often seen at Austin Bitcoin events. Speaking of which, Nifty’s next Bitcoin++ event will be in Austin, TX on May 7-9, diving deep into the Bitcoin Mempool.\n\n### Supertestnet\n\nAn early member of the Plelab and Bitcoin Austin scene, Supertestnet appeared out of nowhere in 2021, quickly mastering the art of creating Bitcoin prototypes in JavaScript. He has since implemented cutting-edge Bitcoin technologies like BitVM, even participating in the first Ark mainnet pool, the only other noncustodial Bitcoin layer-2 scaling solution, and is an avid user of X and Nostr.\n\nSupertestnet’s many open source projects, passion for Bitcoin, and unshakable integrity have granted him quick recognition in the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem and likely a fair mention in the annals of Bitcoin history.\n\n### Cascdr\n\nLed by Jim, AI engineer and ruthless Bitcoin maxi, Cascdr’s mission is to bring the power of AI and Bitcoin together with strong privacy foundations and a full suite of cool AI apps and workflows. His most recent hit is PullThatUpJamie.ai a podcast search engine that transcribes voice content making it searchable, and facilitating the creation of sharable podcast clips.\n\n### BRANTA\n\nLed by Keith, Branta is a cyber security company focused on limiting man-in-the-middle attacks for Bitcoin payments work flows, such as the injection of malicious addresses or invoices in a merchant interface. Grown from the PlebLab accelerator, Branta has already had successful pre-seed raises and was a top-five finalist at the Top Builder contest.\n\n### Topher\n\nA renowned Bitcoin developer in his own right and a regular at PlebLab, Topher has shipped a variety of open source Bitcoin tools such as Tapscript, a library for managing Taproot, Schnorr Signatures, and Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAmong other things, Topher and Austin (app developer) are currently working on Frostr, a key management solution for private digital identities. Specifically, Frostr is built to solve issues of the sort in Nostr, the Bitcoin-adjacent social network protocol that’s become very popular with Bitcoin users. It reimagines “Frost,” the new and rising multisignature standard in Bitcoin wallets, and uses it to solve key rotation problems in Nostr. A bit of a technical project, but one which I believe is profoundly useful and I’ll be covering in more detail very soon.\n\n### Christopher David, Open Agents\n\nChristopher, a seasoned Bitcoin developer and entrepreneur, is currently working on Open Agents, an AI platform with deep integration with Git processes rocking a dark-cypherpunk aesthetic and a strong focus on the privacy of its users.\n\nThere are many more projects that are either in development or have gone through PlebLab through the years, if you are interested you can find them at PlebLab.dev.\n\nAs a bonus, I’ll leave you with this cool Bitcoin Magazine yoyo I happened to find at PlebLab.\n\nTags: Accelerator, Austin, cypherpunk, Startups, Texas\n",
