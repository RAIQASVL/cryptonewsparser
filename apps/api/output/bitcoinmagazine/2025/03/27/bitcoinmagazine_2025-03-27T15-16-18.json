This follows the company’s recent decision to update its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.\n\nAuthor: Nik | Date: March 26, 2025\n\nCategories: NEWS, BUSINESS\n\nGameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) announced today that it intends to raise $1.3 billion through a private offering of convertible senior notes and will use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin. The move comes a day after the company revealed an update to its investment policy, allowing Bitcoin to be used as a treasury reserve asset.\n\nThe offering consists of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2030. Additionally, the company plans to grant initial purchasers an option to buy up to $200 million more in notes within a 13-day period from the first issuance date. The notes will be general unsecured obligations and will not bear regular interest or accrete in value. They will mature on April 1, 2030, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased earlier.\n\nUpon conversion, GameStop will have the option to settle in cash, shares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of both. The initial conversion rate and other terms will be determined at the time of pricing. The company stated that it expects to use the U.S. composite volume-weighted average price of its stock from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the pricing date as the reference for the initial conversion price.\n\nGameStop emphasized that neither the notes nor any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion have been or will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws. As a result, they may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption. The company also stated that there are no assurances that the offering will be completed as described or at all.\n\nThis marks a significant financial decision for GameStop as it pivots toward integrating Bitcoin into its corporate strategy. A strategy pioneered by Strategy’s Michael Saylor, who met with GameStop’s CEO Ryan Cohen in person last month, and has definitely appeared to have had an influence on the GameStop’s decision to embrace BTC as a reserve asset.\n\nTags: Bitcoin, Bitcoin For Corporations, gamestop, GME, michael saylor, Ryan Cohen, Strategy\n",

    "full_content": "# We’ve Turned A Generation of Bitcoiners Into Digital Goldbugs\n\nBitcoiners have made a serious strategic error in focus with how we have evangelized to the newcomers.\n\nAuthor: Shinobi | Date: March 26, 2025\n\nCategories: FEATURED, TAKES\n\nBitcoin is a technology. It is not some force of the universe, some natural element or mineral that was “discovered” floating out in the ether. It is a technology. Technologies are created by human beings, not discovered. They are designed. That design has intent, elements of it are made specifically in a way to facilitate that intent. The tolerances of what a technology can or cannot handle are a result of those design decisions, which are in turn a result of the intent.\n\nNew Bitcoiners are being brought into the world of Bitcoin through a lens that obscures and distorts the realities of Bitcoin as a technology and what that entails, and tries to pack it into the box of “digital gold.”\n\nBitcoiners are becoming goldbugs. People who think Bitcoin is some magic thing that is decentralized “just cause,” whose future success is preordained and an absolute certainty.\n\nThis is a disastrous way for people to conceptualize Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a decentralized computer network. The conditions of a network are not a static thing. Environments change, network loads change, behavior of network users change. All of these things can have impacts on the viability and functioning of the network itself.\n\nGold doesn’t need patches for vulnerabilities. Gold doesn’t have to overhaul major subsystems because a change in user behavior overloaded them to the point of not functioning correctly or efficiently. Gold doesn’t need to worry about Denial of Service attack vectors that could disrupt, or worst case bring down, the entire “gold network.”\n\nBitcoin does. Bitcoin is not “digital gold,” it is a decentralized network made of software individuals actually have to run and maintain. The Bitcoin goldbugs have completely lost connection with this reality, at least when it comes to rationally assessing risks to Bitcoin, or ways it genuinely could fail or be co-opted.\n\nBitcoin is going to have problems it needs to solve, at a fundamental technical level. It already does, and it will have more. This is how technology works, it is an inherent part of it. Bitcoin’s value stems from its use as a censorship resistant network, a freedom money no one can stop you from using. That is its core valuable characteristic.\n\nThat characteristic hinges entirely on its decentralized nature.\n\nIf people do not work to defend that decentralized nature, to interact with Bitcoin in a decentralized fashion, to improve and fix it as needed to counteract limitations or pressures encouraging centralization, then it will not remain decentralized.\n\nWe are going to very soon regret the consequences of focusing so much outreach the last few cycles purely on spreading this “digital gold” narrative. This entire generation of Bitcoiners does not fundamentally understand that decentralization isn’t a static unchanging characteristic set in stone forever.\n\nIt needs to be maintained.\n\nThis article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author’s and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nTags: Bitcoiners, goldbugs, Technology\n",

    "full_content": "# GameStop’s Bitcoin Move Looks Bold—But It Might Be Brilliant\n\nGameStop’s Bitcoin move left many scratching their heads. But behind the confusion is a clear, calculated strategy that more CFOs should be watching closely.\n\nAuthor: Nick Ward | Date: March 26, 2025\n\nCategories: BITCOIN FOR CORPORATIONS\n\nThis week, GameStop quietly updated its investment policy to include Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. With approximately $4.78 billion in cash—nearly 37% of its $12.9 billion market cap—this move marks more than just a diversification of reserves.\n\nIt’s a signal that corporate treasury strategy is evolving. That excess cash on the balance sheet can—and perhaps should—be more than idle. And that new asset classes are gaining legitimacy in the boardroom, not just on message boards.\n\nGameStop’s move may not be typical. But it is highly strategic—and increasingly relevant for CFOs evaluating how to preserve capital and unlock value in a shifting macro landscape.\n\n## Why Bitcoin—and Why Now?\n\nFor companies with material cash holdings, the erosion of purchasing power is no longer theoretical—it’s measurable. Over the past decade, the U.S. dollar has declined in real terms by more than 25%, driven by inflation, expansionary monetary policy, and global fiscal uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin presents a compelling counterweight to this degradation, particularly for balance sheets with the flexibility to tolerate mark-to-market volatility in pursuit of long-term strategic payoff.\n\nConsider its defining characteristics:\n\n- Fixed supply: Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, making it the only digital asset engineered to be verifiably scarce in a world of expanding monetary supply.\n- Global liquidity: Bitcoin trades 24/7 in deep global markets, offering CFOs a high-liquidity, non-sovereign asset class accessible without jurisdictional constraints.\n- Resilience to monetary intervention: Bitcoin is not subject to interest rate policy, quantitative easing, or the political whims of central banks.\n- Long-term outperformance: With a 6-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 72.7%, Bitcoin has dramatically outpaced equities, bonds, and real estate over the same period.\n\nFor CFOs thinking in 3, 5, or 10-year increments, the case for allocating even a small portion of excess cash to Bitcoin is no longer fringe—it’s prudent exploration.\n\n## Accounting Clarity Unlocks Strategic Action\n\nUntil recently, many finance teams ruled out Bitcoin simply due to unfavorable accounting treatment. Under legacy GAAP standards, Bitcoin had to be impaired when its price dropped, but could not be revalued when it recovered—an asymmetric model that distorted true economic value and discouraged adoption.\n\nIn late 2024, that barrier was removed.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved new rules that now allow companies to measure Bitcoin at fair market value. Beginning in 2025, companies can:\n\n- Reflect both unrealized gains and losses in earnings\n- Report Bitcoin more transparently in financial statements\n- Align accounting treatment with actual asset performance\n\nThis change addresses one of the most common objections from CFOs and audit committees alike. It brings Bitcoin into compliance with modern reporting standards—making it viable not just for speculation, but for responsible treasury management.\n\n## Why GameStop Was a Natural Fit\n\nEvery company has a unique capital structure, investor base, and operational profile. GameStop’s decision to allocate to Bitcoin wasn’t just bold—it was structurally appropriate.\n\n- High liquidity: With over $4.78 billion in cash and equivalents, GameStop’s balance sheet provides room for allocation without compromising near-term operations.\n- Resilient investor base: GameStop’s shareholders have already demonstrated long-term conviction and a willingness to support unorthodox but calculated strategies.\n- Cultural alignment: As a company that challenged Wall Street norms in 2021, GameStop’s embrace of a decentralized, digital reserve asset aligns with its identity as a financial outlier.\n\nThis doesn’t mean Bitcoin is a fit for every public company. But for those with excess reserves and a forward-looking treasury mindset, it deserves serious consideration.\n\n## The Bigger Picture: What It Means for Other Companies\n\nGameStop’s move is part of a broader rethinking of the traditional treasury reserve model. For decades, companies stored value in cash, short-term bonds, and dollar-denominated equivalents. But in today’s environment, those instruments may preserve nominal value while degrading purchasing power.\n\nBitcoin introduces an alternative—and the macro backdrop is increasingly supportive.\n\n- Ongoing inflation: Despite cooling from its peak, inflation remains persistently above central bank targets, steadily eroding the real value of corporate cash holdings.\n- Elevated debt levels: Sovereign debt across developed nations continues to climb, increasing the likelihood of future currency devaluation and suppressing real yields.\n- ETF-driven validation: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has introduced new channels for institutional participation, signaling broader market legitimacy.\n- Shift in investor expectations: As digital-native generations begin to shape capital markets, shareholder interest in Bitcoin and hard assets is rising—especially among retail and growth-oriented investors.\n\nThese tailwinds create space for CFOs to begin allocating conservatively—without needing to commit to a radical overhaul of reserve strategy.\n\n## A Quiet Signal to the Market\n\nGameStop’s move didn’t come with a flashy press conference or social media fanfare. It came through a formal policy update—exactly how strategic treasury decisions are typically made.\n\nThe signal it sends is simple but important: “We believe excess capital should be protected—and positioned for asymmetric upside.”\n\nBitcoin is not a cure-all. But it is now, for the first time, auditable, liquid, and institutionally viable. For CFOs with flexibility and foresight, exploring Bitcoin is no longer about being first—it’s about preparing for what’s next.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations. This article is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation to acquire, purchase, or subscribe for securities.\n\nTags: Bitcoin, Bitcoin For Corporations, bitcoin treasury, Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, Corporate Bitcoin Strategy, gamestop\n",

    "full_content": "# Congressman Ro Khanna Says Democrats Are Changing Their Tune On Bitcoin\n\nFor years, Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA) has been one of the few Democratic politicians in the U.S. government who's been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, but now he says that more Democratic elected officials as well as prominent voices in the party are coming to support his stance.\n\nAuthor: Frank Corva | Date: March 26, 2025\n\nCategories: POLITICS, FEATURED\n\nOn March 11, 2025, Rep. Ro Khanna gave a short but impactful talk at the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s Bitcoin for America summit.\n\n“Bitcoin is transformational for so many people around the world,” Rep. Khanna stated at the summit. “That is why the Democratic Party should be embracing it as something that can create financial empowerment for people not just in the United States, but around the world.”\n\nThis is the type of message he’s been spreading for years now, and he’s urged his fellow Democrats to follow his lead. He’s implored them to not be scared of Bitcoin but to view it just as they view other major technological advancements of our time, including the internet itself.\n\n“My goal is to make Bitcoin bipartisan,” Rep. Khanna told Bitcoin Magazine. “I want to convince Democrats that bitcoin is a next-generation store of value that millions of people around the world use and that America showing leadership on it allows us to connect with these people, often some of the most disenfranchised.”\n\nFor a party that often advocates for financial inclusion, it seems almost ironic that so many Democrats have looked past Bitcoin, an open-source technology that anyone can use with nothing more than an internet connection (and, in some cases, even without one).\n\nWith that said, Rep. Khanna made the point that, while he remains one of the few more vocal Democrats when it comes to being pro-Bitcoin, the number of Democratic politicians who have stated that they’re in favor of the technology has increased substantially over the past few years.\n\n“We went from just 10 of us or so supporting Bitcoin and crypto to almost 70 or 80,” said Rep. Khanna. “It’s happening slowly.”\n\nAnd while some have attributed to malice most Democrats’ historical stance on Bitcoin, Rep. Khanna claims the issue is more a lack of understanding of the technology’s purpose and use cases.\n\n“Some Democratic politicians are not aware of how helpful Bitcoin can be with remittances or how it can be used by those who don’t have access to U.S. dollars,” said the congressman. “Many people around the world use it for both reasons,” he added, alluding to the idea that many, including some Democrats, might not be aware of this fact.\n\n## The Bitcoin And Crypto Voting Bloc In U.S. Swing States\n\nAccording to research from Coinbase, in each of the swing states in the most recent U.S. presidential election, there were about 10 times the number of crypto holders compared to the vote differential between Biden and Trump in 2020.\n\nHarris lost to Trump in each of these swing states, leaving some to speculate that the turnout of the Bitcoin and crypto voting bloc may have been one of the primary forces that swayed the election in Trump’s favor.\n\nWhile Rep. Khanna doesn’t know to what extent this voting bloc impacted the election results, he agreed that it was likely one of many major factors that affected the outcome of the election.\n\n“I think it made a difference,” said the congressman. “In such a close election, everything matters, and the fact that there were some Democrats who offended Bitcoin and crypto voters was not helpful.”\n\nAnd Rep. Khanna is not alone in acknowledging this.\n\nIn December 2024, at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Van Jones — political analyst, media persona, and prominent voice within the Democratic party — stated that it was to the Democratic party’s detriment that it shut out pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto voters.\n\nRep. Khanna sang Jones’ praises and said that we should be hearing more voices like Jones’ within the Democratic party speaking up in favor of Bitcoin in the near future.\n\n“I have a lot of respect for Van Jones,” said Rep. Khanna.\n\n“He spent some time in the Bay Area, so he gets technology. The party will be moving in a direction that’s going to embrace Bitcoin and other technologies,” he added.\n\n## Will President Trump’s Embrace Of Bitcoin Deter Democrats From Supporting It?\n\nWhile it only seems logical that the Democratic party would reverse its stance on Bitcoin if it’s looking to pick up seats on the House and Senate come the 2026 midterm elections, it simultaneously seems difficult to imagine more Democrats coming out in support of Bitcoin given the highly partisan political climate in the U.S. coupled with the fact that President Trump is an ardent Bitcoin supporter.\n\nRep. Khanna argued that Democrats shouldn’t be thinking along party lines when it comes to Bitcoin, but rather assessing the technology based solely on what it is.\n\n“Politicians are capable of evaluating Bitcoin on its merits,” said Rep. Khanna.\n\n“Bitcoin is just a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without a need for an intermediary. People just need to study Bitcoin and learn that it’s just a medium of exchange,” he added.\n\nRep. Khanna also took a moment to differentiate between Bitcoin and meme coins, highlighting the fact that the president’s recently released coin ($TRUMP) creates much confusion regarding the value proposition of crypto assets, including bitcoin.\n\n“We shouldn’t have elected officials like President Trump launching meme coins,” said the congressman.\n\n## Getting Democrats on the Right Side of History\n\nAt a time when many U.S. citizens are struggling to make ends meet, should Bitcoin be a front-and-center issue for Democrats, once widely regarded as the political party of the middle and working class?\n\nRep. Khanna doesn’t necessarily think so, but he also doesn’t think the party should continue to pooh-pooh the technology.\n\n“There are far bigger issues at hand right now like the cuts in Medicaid, the firing of veterans, and the erratic policy of tariffs,” the congressman explained.\n\n“But the Democrats were on the wrong side of issues of innovation and Bitcoin in 2022 and 2024, and we now have an opportunity to get on the right side of it,” he added.\n\nSo, how can pro-Bitcoin Democrat voters help to get their party on the right side of history when it comes to Bitcoin?\n\nRep. Khanna had a few suggestions:\n\n“They should point to those of us who are leading on Bitcoin and crypto,” he said.\n\n“They can encourage members of government to study the issue, so that they’re not uninformed,” he added.\n\n“And they should talk about the enormous adoption of Bitcoin.”\n\nTags: Bitcoin, Democrats, Politics, ro khanna, U.S. House of Representatives\n",

You can watch the full video here: Will MicroStrategy Realistically Surpass $1,000 – Data Analysis\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- Strategy’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Over 500,000 BTC\n- Strategy Data Dashboard: A New Tool from Bitcoin Magazine Pro\n- Can Strategy’s MSTR Price Reach $1,000? Data-Backed Scenarios\n- Capital Raises Fuel Future BTC Accumulation\n- MSTR Insights Based on Numbers\n- Strategy vs. Bitcoin: Volatility and Correlation Analysis\n- Limitations: Will Strategy Ever Rival Apple in Market Cap?\n- Conclusion: Strategy’s MSTR Price Outlook is Bullish but Speculative\n\n### Strategy’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Over 500,000 BTC\n\nStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has firmly positioned itself as a Bitcoin-centric company. In less than five years, it has accumulated over 500,000 BTC—accounting for more than 2.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply—turning its stock into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure.\n\n### Strategy Data Dashboard: A New Tool from Bitcoin Magazine Pro\n\nThe video introduces the new Treasury Analytics dashboard on BitcoinMagazinePro.com. This tool provides vital insights into Strategy’s:\n\n- Real-time Bitcoin holdings\n- Net Asset Value (NAV) premiums\n- Stock price data\n- Historical volatility\n\nThis dashboard empowers investors to assess the intrinsic value of MSTR and its correlation to Bitcoin price movements.\n\n### Can Strategy’s MSTR Price Reach $1,000? Data-Backed Scenarios\n\nMatt Crosby walks through multiple valuation models based on the following assumptions:\n\n- Bitcoin price levels at $100K, $150K, and $200K\n- BTC holdings expanding to 700K or even 800K BTC\n- NAV premiums ranging from 2x to 3.5x\n\nUsing these inputs, Crosby outlines realistic Strategy stock price targets between $950 and $2,000. In ultra-bullish scenarios, extreme targets of $15,000 or even $25,000 are modeled, though acknowledged as speculative.\n\n### Capital Raises Fuel Future BTC Accumulation\n\nTo support further Bitcoin acquisition, Strategy is leveraging several financial instruments:\n\n- A $2.1 billion at-the-money stock offering\n- A $711 million perpetual preferred stock issuance\n\nThese capital raises could enable the company to purchase an additional 200K to 300K BTC.\n\n### MSTR Insights Based on Numbers\n\nFor investors closely tracking Strategy (MSTR), the numbers tell a powerful story:\n\n- 500,000+ BTC Accumulated: Strategy now holds over 2.41% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist — making it the go-to public stock for BTC exposure.\n- From $9 to $543: Since 2020, MSTR’s stock has soared from around $9 to over $543 (adjusted for stock splits), thanks largely to its Bitcoin accumulation strategy.\n- Revenue vs. BTC Value: While Strategy pulled in $463 million in software revenue in 2024, its Bitcoin holdings are worth around $43 billion — it would take a century of software sales to match its BTC portfolio.\n- Capital to Buy More BTC: The company is raising $2.1 billion through stock offerings and has already secured $711 million via preferred shares — funding that could add another 200K–300K BTC to its balance sheet.\n- NAV Premiums Matter: At times, MSTR has traded at a 3.4x premium to its net asset value. The current premium is around 1.7x, with room to expand in a bullish market.\n- Higher Volatility Than BTC: MSTR’s price swings are more intense than Bitcoin’s — its 3-month volatility peaked at 7.56%, compared to BTC’s 3.32%.\n- Deeper Drawdowns in Bear Markets: In past down cycles, BTC lost about 80%, but MSTR fell as much as 90%, showing it tends to amplify Bitcoin’s moves.\n\nTogether, these figures highlight both the massive upside potential and the high volatility risk that come with investing in Strategy.\n\n### Strategy vs. Bitcoin: Volatility and Correlation Analysis\n\nCrosby points out that Strategy tends to move even more sharply than Bitcoin. Over the past three months, Bitcoin’s volatility averaged around 3.32%, while MSTR’s volatility reached 7.56% — more than double.\n\nLooking back at bear markets, Bitcoin typically retraced about 80%, but Strategy’s stock fell closer to 90%. This highlights that Strategy doesn’t just follow Bitcoin — it amplifies it. That means bigger gains in bull markets, but also steeper losses during downturns.\n\n### Limitations: Will Strategy Ever Rival Apple in Market Cap?\n\nWhile the numbers might hint at sky-high stock price possibilities, reaching them is another story. For Strategy to seriously compete with tech giants like Apple, it would need to:\n\n- Accumulate between 850,000 and 1 million BTC\n- See Bitcoin’s total market cap rise above gold’s $20 trillion\n- Sustain a net asset value (NAV) premium of 3x to 4x consistently\n\nEven if all that happened, Strategy’s market cap would need to grow by 45 times to match Apple’s $3.3 trillion valuation. That kind of leap is extremely unlikely in this current cycle — it’s more of a long-term, speculative scenario.\n\n### Conclusion: Strategy’s MSTR Price Outlook is Bullish but Speculative\n\nAccording to Matt Crosby’s analysis, Strategy’s MSTR price reaching $1,000 or even $2,000 is entirely within the realm of possibility during this market cycle—provided Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory and investor sentiment remains bullish. These targets are grounded in data models that factor in current BTC holdings, potential future acquisitions, and historical NAV premiums.\n\nHowever, this opportunity doesn’t come without its caveats. Strategy’s stock is known for its heightened volatility—often exceeding that of Bitcoin itself—which makes it a high-beta, high-risk investment vehicle. Investors considering MSTR should be prepared for significant price swings and prolonged drawdowns, particularly during Bitcoin market corrections.\n\nThat said, for long-term Bitcoin believers and those with a higher tolerance for risk, Strategy offers a compelling, leveraged play on the broader crypto market. With its continued accumulation strategy and substantial institutional backing, MSTR remains one of the most data-driven and high-conviction ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s future growth.\n\nAs always, potential investors should do their due diligence, factor in risk management strategies, and align their investments with personal financial goals and time horizons.\n\nIf you’re interested in more in-depth analysis and real-time data, consider checking out Bitcoin Magazine Pro for valuable insights into the Bitcoin market.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

They host various events and meetups throughout the year and have become a reliable work environment for Bitcoiners, whether living in Austin or just passing through.\n\n“In art school, I had this professor who’d make us stop after an hour of creating, walk around, and give honest feedback on each other’s work—it built a collaborative vibe where we can grow together. That stuck with me,” Car González, CEO of PlebLab, recalls. So when I took over PlebLab, I asked: ‘How do I make it more collaborative? How do I make it more about that, not just coworking?’ When you say coworking, it’s literally just working. How boring is that—working among other people who are also working? That’s not fun.”\n\nYet more than just a “coworking” space, PlebLab has become a “community accelerator for the Bitcoin era” with multiple successful Bitcoin companies and developer celebrities going through it since its inception.\n\n## Genesis\n\nFounded out of the dream to build on Bitcoin and grow a local community, PlebLab got its first office in Capital Factory, a renown tech coworking hub in Austin in 2021. The three cofounders, Car González, Keyan Kousha, and Kyle Murphy started doing Bitcoin meetups that grew to crowds of over 200 people. Among them, various entrepreneurs and Bitcoin developers started to stick around, asking to co-work with them out of Capital Factory.\n\nOver time PlebLab grew into different office locations, currently installed next to the Unchained Capital offices and the Bitcoin Park (Formerly Bitcoin Commons) in downtown Austin (at 6th St. and Congress Ave.). With more space, talent, and experience, PlebLab transformed from a coworking space into a mix between a hacker garage and a start-up incubator.\n\nToday they offer various membership packages, mentorship, and a wealth of resources to start-ups that join them, but this is not a pay-to-play “Bitcoin We-work”: Memberships can be denied depending on the goals and purpose of the project. It’s more akin to a private Bitcoin club for builders and technologists than anything else.\n\n“I really think we’re an accelerator for the Bitcoin era. How you do that in an open source, cypherpunk way is you don’t give somebody 500k on day one and say, ‘You got three months to make it or see you later.’ To me, that sounds like a fiat-era thing,” said Car.\n\n## Main Events\n\nThe main events held by PlebLab are Top Builder and Startup Day. Often taking place within six months of each other.“Top Builder is the Top Chef of Bitcoin. We try to find the latest, greatest builders, pile them in, and get them to build an MVP or something pitchable,” said Car, describing the event which functions like a three-month hackathon, exposing finalists to VCs and angel investors.\n\nStartup Day on the other hand is a short conference that provides a platform for Bitcoin start-ups to present their work, meet talent, and get exposure in the Bitcoin world. In Car’s words it is meant to “inspire people to go from the sidelines to building their own company. They’ll see themselves in those people talking on stage.”\n\n## Judge it by its Fruit\n\nA variety of big names within the Bitcoin start-up world have spent time in PlebLab, Car was very hesitant to take credit for the work of others, and stressed his admiration for the founders and leaders whose journey he has witnessed.\n\n“Seeing their journey go from a person you meet, shake hands with initially, to where they are—seeing the numbers they have, and when they get to a point like base camp, a raise, a pre-seed or seed”, Car said. “That base camp for me is just, ‘Cool, they did it.’ Now, let’s go help somebody else. That’s the thing I love—the shipment of the code, so to speak—We just try to be good stewards of that.”\n\nNevertheless, the track record is impressive. Here’s a quick overview of Bitcoin projects, companies, and developer celebrities closely associated with PlebLab:\n\n### Jippi – Winner of Top Builder 2025\n\nLead by Oliver, Jippi.app is a beautiful and fun Bitcoin app designed with Gen Z in mind. Echoing the success of Pokemon Go, Jippi invites young people to explore their cities in search of Bitcoin Beasts, charming little 3D creatures that hide in augmented reality, waiting for future owners with sats rewards.The app has been in development for over a year and just last week won the first prize in PlebLab’s Top Builder competition among fierce competition. Mind-blowing to the judges and audience alike, Jippi has a live, functioning app, man-on-the-street surveys, and app tests in a local university. As well as a masterful presentation of the rationale and vision for Jippi, the app may have the potential to go viral in the United States — and with it bring a new generation into Bitcoin.\n\n### Stacker.news\n\nStarted in 2021 by one of PlebLab’s cofounders Keyan Kousha, Stacker.news has quickly become a hub of news for many tech-savvy Bitcoiners. Boasting an open source Lightning-powered Reddit, the platform has gathered an active and loyal fan base that reward each other with sats for every upvote, often being early to integrate the latest technologies in the Bitcoin-social media tech scene.\n\n### Zaprite\n\nStarted at the end of 2021 by John Magill, Zaprite has quickly grown into a full payment gateway suite for businesses, supporting both Bitcoin and Lightning payment rails as well as event ticketing and all the accounting and invoicing tools necessary for a modern merchant.\n\nZaprite made recent history by being the interface Donald J. Trump used to pay for a burger with bitcoin at the Bitcoin Pub Pub Key in New York.\n\n(TRUMP BUYS BURGER WITH BITCOIN FROM ZAPRITE – EMBED)\n\n### Mutiny Wallet\n\nLaunched in early 2023 and led by celebrity Bitcoin developers Ben Carman and Tony Giorgio, Mutiny Wallet quickly gained popularity among Lightning power users as a fully featured and innovative Bitcoin app. It consistently integrated cutting-edge payments technology like e-cash-denominated payments and Nostr integration, while rocking its signature red-and-black color scheme.Following the arrest of Samourai Wallet developers and the consequent chilling effect on Bitcoin self-custody wallet development, Mutiny Wallet announced it would be sunsetting the project, nevertheless demonstrating incredible technical ability and leaving behind a sophisticated set of open source software tools for the Lighting, Nostr, and e-cash ecosystem.\n\n### Nifty (Bitcoin++)\n\nAs a Bitcoin and Lightning developer, Nifty became famous for her developer education efforts via Base 58, her world-renowned developer events called Bitcoin++, her relentless work ethic, impressive travel schedule, and of course her charm, bringing together Bitcoin developer communities all over the world, multiple times a year.Nifty has quickly become a recognized and influential figure in the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem, including a seat on the board of directors of Opensats, a public charity focused on funding open source Bitcoin projects of all types, with a special focus on Nostr – the Bitcoin native social media protocol. In her journey to stardom, she spent significant time at PlebLab, and is still often seen at Austin Bitcoin events. Speaking of which, Nifty’s next Bitcoin++ event will be in Austin, TX on May 7-9, diving deep into the Bitcoin Mempool.\n\n### Supertestnet\n\nAn early member of the Plelab and Bitcoin Austin scene, Supertestnet appeared out of nowhere in 2021, quickly mastering the art of creating Bitcoin prototypes in JavaScript. He has since implemented cutting-edge Bitcoin technologies like BitVM, even participating in the first Ark mainnet pool, the only other noncustodial Bitcoin layer-2 scaling solution, and is an avid user of X and Nostr.\n\nSupertestnet’s many open source projects, passion for Bitcoin, and unshakable integrity have granted him quick recognition in the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem and likely a fair mention in the annals of Bitcoin history.\n\n### Cascdr\n\nLed by Jim, AI engineer and ruthless Bitcoin maxi, Cascdr’s mission is to bring the power of AI and Bitcoin together with strong privacy foundations and a full suite of cool AI apps and workflows. His most recent hit is PullThatUpJamie.ai a podcast search engine that transcribes voice content making it searchable, and facilitating the creation of sharable podcast clips.\n\n### BRANTA\n\nLed by Keith, Branta is a cyber security company focused on limiting man-in-the-middle attacks for Bitcoin payments work flows, such as the injection of malicious addresses or invoices in a merchant interface. Grown from the PlebLab accelerator, Branta has already had successful pre-seed raises and was a top-five finalist at the Top Builder contest.\n\n### Topher\n\nA renowned Bitcoin developer in his own right and a regular at PlebLab, Topher has shipped a variety of open source Bitcoin tools such as Tapscript, a library for managing Taproot, Schnorr Signatures, and Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAmong other things, Topher and Austin (app developer) are currently working on Frostr, a key management solution for private digital identities. Specifically, Frostr is built to solve issues of the sort in Nostr, the Bitcoin-adjacent social network protocol that’s become very popular with Bitcoin users. It reimagines “Frost,” the new and rising multisignature standard in Bitcoin wallets, and uses it to solve key rotation problems in Nostr. A bit of a technical project, but one which I believe is profoundly useful and I’ll be covering in more detail very soon.\n\n### Christopher David, Open Agents\n\nChristopher, a seasoned Bitcoin developer and entrepreneur, is currently working on Open Agents, an AI platform with deep integration with Git processes rocking a dark-cypherpunk aesthetic and a strong focus on the privacy of its users.\n\nThere are many more projects that are either in development or have gone through PlebLab through the years, if you are interested you can find them at PlebLab.dev.\n\nAs a bonus, I’ll leave you with this cool Bitcoin Magazine yoyo I happened to find at PlebLab.\n\nTags: Accelerator, Austin, cypherpunk, Startups, Texas\n",

(NYSE: GME) announced that its board of directors has unanimously approved an update to the company’s investment policy, allowing Bitcoin to be held as a treasury reserve asset. The decision follows a series of engagements between GameStop Chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen and prominent figures like Michael Saylor in the Bitcoin industry.\n\nOn February 8, Cohen met with Strategy Chairman and well-known Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, sparking speculation that GameStop may be adding BTC to its balance sheet. A couple weeks after, Cohen responded to CoinDesk via a tweet stating “Letter received.” after receiving a letter from Strive Asset Management CEO Matt Cole, which urged GameStop to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset.\n\nIn its announcement, GameStop noted that its investment policy now permits investments in “certain cryptocurrency assets, including Bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins.” The company also acknowledged associated risks, including the potential impact of these investments on its financial results and internal financial controls.\n\nThe policy update was disclosed alongside the company’s financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended February 1, 2025.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, GameStop reported net sales of $1.283 billion, a decrease from $1.794 billion in the same period the prior year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses fell to $282.5 million, compared to $359.2 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year. Net income for the quarter was $131.3 million, up from $63.1 million a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $96.5 million, compared to $88.0 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter.\n\nGameStop also disclosed that it held $4.775 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. The company completed its exit from Italy and finalized the wind-down of store operations in Germany during this period.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, GameStop reported net sales of $3.823 billion, down from $5.273 billion in fiscal year 2023. SG&A expenses for the year were $1.130 billion, compared to $1.324 billion in the prior year. Net income for the year reached $131.3 million, significantly higher than the $6.7 million reported in fiscal year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $36.1 million, compared to $64.7 million in the previous year.\n\nThe company has not yet disclosed how much Bitcoin it plans to purchase or when it will begin acquiring BTC, and CEO Ryan Cohen has not yet commented publicly on the addition of Bitcoin to GameStop’s balance sheet at the time of publishing.\n\nTags: Bitcoin, Bitcoin For Corporations, gamestop, michael saylor, Ryan Cohen, Treasury Reserve\n",

    "full_content": "# Stablecoins Are The CBDCs\n\nThe bogeyman of CBDCs are nothing more than a distraction from the real financial surveillance and control threat: stablecoins.\n\nAuthor: Shinobi | Date: March 25, 2025\n\nCategories: TAKES, FEATURED\n\nPeople like to refer to Bitcoin as a trojan horse that we are going to smuggle into the legacy financial system and government. Stablecoins are a trojan horse into our system that has already been successfully smuggled in.\n\nStablecoins are heralded as some savior of the developing world, a positive escape hatch for them from decrepit financial systems and local currency risks. Well that’s the thing about traps, they have to entice you to wander into them or they don’t function very well as traps do they?\n\nAll of the stablecoin volume of significance happens on highly centralized blockchains, issued through highly centralized smart contracts that almost entirely (with rare exceptions like Liquid currently) have the power to arbitrarily freeze or confiscate any outstanding stablecoin tokens. A single party, the issuer, for the super majority of tokens they have issued, can freeze and seize their funds. Anywhere. Anyone. Globally.\n\nThese blockchains almost all function on an account model as well, meaning that default behavior associates every transaction a user makes with a single public address identifier, putting their entire transactional history in full view of the world with a single glance. No UTXO clustering, no fancy analysis needed, just look at the account address.\n\nTo compound things even further, because all of these chains are highly centralized, there is no software to speak of that general users interact with that is fully validating. Wallets connect to one of a few highly centralized servers every time they interact with their account and associate their IP address with that account.\n\nThis is a trap. Pure and simple. The United States does not need a CBDC, it has US Dollar stablecoins. They already function in a way that concentrates all private information that could connect individuals to their on-chain activity in a few hands. All it takes is one interaction with a KYC exchange, or an address posted online, connection to a social media account, and you’re identified.\n\nStablecoins are just as programmable as a CBDC. Just as capable of implementing restrictions like expiring money, or money that can only be spent in certain ways or certain places. What’s the only difference between the two that matters? Adoption. Stablecoins are viewed favorably, and highly used, whereas most places the sentiment is very against CBDCs.\n\nAll of the pieces are there. The central point of control to seize the tokens, the total lack of privacy that makes a single association of KYC data a permanent surveillance mark, and the complete concentration of where that private information will wind up. All there to be snatched up and collected by the US government whenever it wants, and used to coerce stablecoin issuers into acting how they see fit.\n\nThese stablecoins are US dollar proxies, they must interact with the legacy financial system, they have to hold actual dollars and treasuries. It is necessitated by how they work. They are under the government’s thumb, particularly the US government’s thumb, whenever the government wishes it.\n\nIt blows my mind that people not only accept the process of this happening, but some actively cheer it on. Bitcoin aims to be a truly sovereign and free money that enables anyone to do whatever they want with their own wealth. Yet we are now apparently cheering on the exact opposite of that riding Bitcoin’s coattails to adoption in parallel.\n\nHelp me make that make sense.\n\nCBDCs are a bogeyman to keep us distracted from the very real threat of a financial surveillance system that’s already here, stablecoins. We should be confronting that, not sweeping it under the rug.\n\nThis article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author’s and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nTags: cbdc, Financial Surveillance, Stablecoins\n",

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, customary consents, and final closing. When completed, approximately 135 Crusoe employees will join NYDIG and continue operating the business under its ownership. No job eliminations are expected as a result of the acquisition. The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.\n\n“Our partnership with Crusoe was founded on a shared cultural alignment and mutual commitment to driving advancements at the intersection of power and compute,” NYDIG CEO Tejas Shah stated. “Crusoe has built an extraordinary bitcoin mining business by demonstrating remarkable innovation—bringing together the industry’s top talent to solve complex challenges and unlock untapped energy sources. We’re incredibly excited to integrate this world-class team and their capabilities into our growing business.”\n\nCrusoe, founded in 2018, developed DFM technology to convert natural gas from oil fields, which would otherwise be burned off as flares, into electricity for modular data centers. The company initially used these data centers for bitcoin mining before expanding into artificial intelligence (AI) workloads powered by GPU clusters. Crusoe’s approach to colocating computing with energy production has contributed to reducing environmental impact while utilizing stranded energy sources.\n\nCrusoe’s bitcoin mining operations have deployed over 425 modular data centers, accounting for more than 250 megawatts of power across multiple states, including Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah, Texas, and internationally in Argentina. According to the company, its DFM technology has mitigated 2.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and prevented nearly 22 billion cubic feet of natural gas from being flared.\n\n“The proof-of-work consensus mechanism in the bitcoin blockchain algorithmically incentivizes the convergence of energy and computing,” said Crusoe co-founder and CEO Chase Lochmiller. “Crusoe is proud to have been a pioneer in repurposing otherwise wasted energy resources such as gas flaring to power the bitcoin network. Our innovative approach to energy utilized for mining is uniquely complementary to NYDIG’s bitcoin custody, institutional trading, and mining businesses, creating a consolidated business that is more valuable than the sum of its parts. We will continue to channel the same energy-first mentality towards scaling AI infrastructure and accelerating the adoption and proliferation of AI in our everyday lives.”\n\nFollowing the deal, Crusoe will shift its focus toward scaling AI infrastructure, building AI-optimized data centers, and expanding its Crusoe Cloud product offerings while continuing to develop energy solutions for its computing operations.\n\nTags: AI, Bitcoin mining, Crusoe, NYDIG\n",

The ETP will trade under the ticker IB1T on Xetra and Euronext Paris and as BTCN on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nThe new product comes after BlackRock debuted a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. last year. The U.S. ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has attracted over $50 billion in assets and has become the largest spot bitcoin ETF globally. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has voiced scepticism of bitcoin but appears to have warmed up to bitcoin amid client demand.\n\nBy launching a European bitcoin ETP, BlackRock is giving institutional investors in the region exposure to bitcoin’s price performance in a familiar and regulated wrapper. Crypto ETPs have existed in Europe for years but lag U.S. bitcoin ETFs in assets.\n\nBlackRock’s bitcoin ETP carries a management fee of 0.25%, reduced to 0.15% through a temporary fee waiver until year-end 2025. The ETP uses Coinbase for custody.\n\nAs the largest asset manager globally with over $10 trillion under management, BlackRock brings significant scale and distribution power. The move signals growing mainstream embrace of bitcoin as an emerging institutional asset class.\n\nTags: Blackrock, Etp, Europe, Larry Fink\n",
