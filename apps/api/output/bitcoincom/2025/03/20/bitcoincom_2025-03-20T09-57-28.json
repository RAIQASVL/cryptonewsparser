According to a report, the National Police took into custody eight individuals, including the Malaga-based computer programmer believed to be the mastermind.</p>\n<p>The arrests follow a three-year investigation into the scheme by the anti-fraud unit of the National Police’s Central Unit for Economic and Financial Crime. The probe found that the mastermind, working with the seven other detainees, created a fake bitcoin investment platform, which they promoted via social media.</p>\n<p>The gang allegedly tricked unsuspecting victims into handing over control of their devices, giving up their personal details and banking data. It also converted thousands of euros on behalf of the investors. However, the gang’s luck ran out after one of the victims lodged a complaint with the police, sparking the investigation.</p>\n<div id=\"custom_html-59\" class=\"widget_text td_block_template_1 widget widget_custom_html\"><div class=\"textwidget custom-html-widget\">  <div></div>  </div></div>\n<p>Following the probe, investigators found that victims were lured by the promise of a 40% return on investment in one month and 300% in one year. Besides investing in bitcoin, victims were also convinced to invest in a worthless virtual currency. An unidentified investigator commenting on the criminal gang’s modus operandi said initially investors received some return.</p>\n<p>The scheme began collapsing when payments to investors stopped. However, by that time, the gang had converted victims’ funds, with some used to purchase 12 motor vehicles and five motorcycles seized by the police.</p>\n<p>At the close of the investigation, the National Police found that the gang had targeted 2,718 Spanish citizens, while the rest were nationals of 36 different countries.</p>\n"

With an index score of 10, Trump is well ahead of second-ranked El Salvador leader Nayib Bukele, who scored 7.</p>\n<p>In a press statement by Boxbet, which conducted the study, said Trump’s support index score of 85% implies that the U.S. has now attained “full crypto adoption” status, making it the only country to achieve this feat. Boxbet also explained why Trump ranked ahead of Bukele and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Under his leadership, the United States has accumulated 207,000 bitcoin worth $17.1 billion, representing 0.99% of all bitcoin in circulation. While the country facilitates 5% of national transactions in cryptocurrency, its policy approach remains regulatory yet supportive. On March 7, the White House hosted its first-ever ‘Crypto Day,’ signaling a strategic push toward integrating digital assets into national economic policy and reinforcing the administration’s commitment to the crypto sector.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is worth noting, however, that the United States already held this bitcoin stockpile, which largely consists of seized coins, before Trump returned as the country’s 47th president. While Boxbet’s study says the U.S. government holds 207,000  <a href=\"https://branch.wallet.bitcoin.com/news-contextual-btc\" class=\"sc-jKFSRx kwbJsy\">BTC</a>, the actual number is closer to <a href=\"https://gov.timechainindex.com/?gov=usg\" class=\"sc-jKFSRx kwbJsy\">199,172 BTC</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"custom_html-59\" class=\"widget_text td_block_template_1 widget widget_custom_html\"><div class=\"textwidget custom-html-widget\">  <div></div>  </div></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, the CSI assesses that cryptocurrency enjoys “moderate support” (61.2%) in Bukele’s government, which made headlines when it made bitcoin legal tender. Third-placed Zelenskyy’s support index score was slightly lower at 59.9%. Finland President Alexander Stubb is ranked sixth with a support index score of 3.4%, representing an “anti-crypto stance.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a Boxbet spokesperson said the findings show that bitcoin is, in fact, a battleground for economic influence and not just a speculative asset anymore. He added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The real question is not whether cryptocurrency will survive but who will shape its future. The tension between decentralization and state adoption is no longer theoretical. It is playing out in real time, from nations stockpiling bitcoin as a hedge against inflation to policymakers weighing the first-ever ETF approvals for meme coins. Each decision signals a deeper shift in how digital assets fit into global power structures.</p></blockquote>\n\n"
