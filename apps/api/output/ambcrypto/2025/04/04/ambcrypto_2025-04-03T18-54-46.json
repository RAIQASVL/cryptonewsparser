The active realized price at $71K shows where moved coins cluster, while the true market mean at $65K sets the core support.\n\nThis range helps anticipate investor actions, as consistent demand here can stabilize prices, even in volatile market conditions.\n\nThe data demonstrates how Bitcoin’s market dynamics align with the identified support zone. The realized price, active realized price, and true market mean price define support between $65,000 and $71,000.\n\nThis suggests that LTHs are unfazed by short-term volatility. The narrowing gap between these metrics shows that recent price moves reflect genuine investor engagement, not speculation.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nSuch alignment between fundamental support metrics is uncommon, highlighting that the market’s perception of value is consolidating in this zone.\n\nBitcoin’s price range between $65,000 and $71,000 is seen as a key accumulation zone for LTHs, while STHs might view it as an opportunity to sell at a perceived top.\n\nIf Bitcoin dips into this range, STHs could exit positions, taking profits, while LTHs may continue accumulating due to the zone’s strategic importance.\n\nThis could lead to volatility, but strong demand may help stabilize prices.\n\nIf Bitcoin falls into this range, buying activity could intensify. Long-term holders may accumulate, seeing value at lower prices. Short-term holders might exit, fearing further drops.\n\nHowever, with consistent demand, Bitcoin could stabilize and potentially rebound. The support zone might act as a cushion against sharp declines.\n\n"

Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass showed that intraday traders were notably betting on the short side.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nAt press time, traders were over-leveraged at $1,783 on the lower side, where they have built $115 million worth of long positions, while $1,848 is another over-leveraged level with $330 million worth of short positions.\n\nThese massive over-leveraged positions reflect the true market sentiment, which appears bearish.\n\n"

This makes BTCC an income-first strategy, potentially ideal for investors seeking regular cash flows and high yielding opportunities.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin Premium Income ETF (BPI) prioritizes long-term appreciation by writing call options with significantly higher strike prices, offering greater upside potential but lower dividend income.\n\nGrayscale added,\n\n“This blended approach provides investors with an opportunity to participate in the capital appreciation potential of Bitcoin with the benefits of income.”\n\nThese contrasting strategies cater to investors with varying risk appetites and market outlooks.\n\nGrayscale’s aggressive expansion in the ETF market comes at a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, which recently dipped to $83,706.40 after a 1.67% decline in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nDespite this downturn, Bitcoin ETFs saw a notable inflow of $218.1 million, although Grayscale’s GBTC recorded no new flows, as reported by Farside Investors.\n\nThat being said, the firm continues to push for broader ETF adoption, filing for a multi-asset crypto ETF and awaiting regulatory approval for spot ETFs tied to Ripple [XRP], Cardano [ADA], Solana, and Litecoin [LTC].\n\nIn fact, the U.S. SEC has formally recognized Grayscale’s 19b-4 filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF.\n\nMeanwhile, Nasdaq’s recent filing with the SEC for a Grayscale Avalanche ETF underscores the company’s commitment to expanding its crypto investment offerings.\n\n"

Bitcoin, which had been trading near $87K, saw a dramatic dip to as low as $82K before staging a mild recovery.\n\nFollowing the sharp drop triggered by Trump’s tariff announcement, Bitcoin attempted to stabilize near the $83,000 mark.\n\nThe latest hourly chart shows a mild recovery after the initial plunge, but momentum remains weak.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe OBV indicates declining buying interest, while the RSI hovers around 45, suggesting neutral to slightly bearish sentiment. With volume tapering off, Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim higher levels remains uncertain.\n\nAs the market digests the broader economic implications, cautious trading is likely to persist.\n\nThe impact was not limited to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum [ETH] dropped by around 5% following the news, struggling to regain lost ground.\n\nXRP and Cardano [ADA] also faced significant declines of approximately 4.6% and 4.9%, respectively, while Solana [SOL] took a more substantial hit, falling over 7%.\n\nBinance Coin [BNB] and TRON [TRX] showed more resilience, but still dipped around 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nDespite some minor rebounds, the collective sentiment across altcoins remains cautious, with bearish momentum persisting.\n\nMarket participants appear to be in ‘wait-and-see’ mode as they assess the longer-term economic implications.\n\n"

Seemingly, it suggests a clear departure from the memecoin’s early reliance on short-term speculative trading.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nIn fact, a comprehensive analysis of wallet behavior shows consistent growth in SHIB holdings by long-term investors—those who have held for more than a year.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nSHIB whales increased their holdings by 7.5% in Q1 2025, despite a 45% price drop. Wallet data shows balances rose from 732 trillion to 787 trillion tokens between the 1st of January and the 2nd of April.\n\nIn contrast, mid-term holders cut positions by 18%. The exodus was even more pronounced among short-term traders, whose holdings plunged by 43%, shrinking from 36 trillion to just under 21 trillion SHIB.\n\nSupporting this behavioral pivot, data from CryptoQuant reveals that SHIB exchange reserves dropped 37.6%, from 139.7 trillion to 87.2 trillion in the same period.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThis sharp outflow suggests tightening sell-side liquidity, typically seen as bullish in volatile conditions.\n\nYet, despite this trend, SHIB’s price continued to fall, suggesting the influence of larger market forces or insufficient demand.\n\nFurther complicating the narrative, IntoTheBlock’s large holder netflow data reveals conflicting behavior.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the 6th and the 7th of January, inflows soared as over 33 trillion Shiba Inu entered exchanges.\n\nNetflows then plunged by more than 212% through February and March. Yet SHIB’s price held steady, hinting that whale moves no longer dictate the market.\n\nDespite this massive swing in large holder behavior, SHIB’s price remained mostly stable during high-volume events.\n\nThis decoupling suggests that whale movements may no longer hold the sway they once did—or that other factors, like retail sentiment or broader market conditions, are taking precedence.\n\nRetail sentiment and broader conditions appear to override big-player influence, suggesting a more mature market. Speculative trading has slowed, while accumulation has strengthened.\n\nCryptoQuant data shows two major netflow spikes.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nFor example, on the 7th of January, 32.94 trillion SHIB flowed into exchanges, then prices slid to $0.0000218. As well as, on the 2nd of March, a 33.84 trillion SHIB influx preceded a drop to $0.00001516.\n\nThese deposits often signal large sell-offs, suggesting strategic repositioning by major holders. Despite these events, exchange reserves shrank, indicating whales’ sales were overshadowed by ongoing withdrawals.\n\nSHIB’s daily chart, despite an 18% drop, remains above key support. On-balance volume shows growing accumulation.\n\nHolding durations are rising, exchange reserves are shrinking, and netflows point to structural change.\n\nLong-term holders now dominate supply, while speculative players wane. Though price has struggled in early 2025, behavioral data suggests strengthening confidence.\n\nIf accumulation persists and exchange liquidity tightens, Shiba Inu could see more stable market behavior soon.\n\n"

Jack McDonald, CEO of Standard Custody, confirmed the rollout, stating,\n\n“RLUSD is now integrated into Ripple Payments—our cross-border payments solution with near-global coverage through 90+ payout markets… Enterprise utility right out of the box.”\n\nThe integration of RLUSD establishes connections with a robust network of banks, financial institutions, and payment providers worldwide.\n\nThis stablecoin provides direct access to deep liquidity, enabling businesses to efficiently settle cross-border transactions.\n\nRipple’s launch of RLUSD goes beyond introducing a stablecoin—it sets the stage for scalable enterprise adoption. The company also announced plans to use RLUSD as collateral for tokenized assets and expand its application within DeFi protocols.\n\nSince its official launch in December 2024, RLUSD has delivered explosive growth. Ripple recently minted 50 million new RLUSD tokens on the XRP Ledger, demonstrating ongoing demand.\n\nConsequently, its total market capitalization surged to an impressive $293.79 million, far exceeding initial projections.\n\nFurthermore, listings on major exchanges such as Kraken and Margex have amplified the token’s exposure. These strategic moves not only drive accessibility but also reflect rising confidence among institutions.\n\nWhile RLUSD still trails industry titans like USDT and USDC, its current trajectory indicates it could soon close the gap.\n\nTherefore, Ripple’s execution around RLUSD proves that utility, compliance, and adoption can scale together—quickly.\n\nThe stablecoin market has become a fierce battleground. Circle recently filed for an IPO, and Tether acquired 8,888 BTC, signaling aggressive expansion strategies from Ripple’s main competitors. These moves indicate that established players are gearing up for long-term market dominance.\n\nRipple, however, is taking a different approach. By tying RLUSD to regulatory compliance and enterprise-grade infrastructure, Ripple aims to position the stablecoin among the top five globally by late 2025.\n\nThe firm also seeks to achieve a $3 billion market cap, firmly establishing RLUSD in the upper echelon of digital assets.\n\nUnlike its competitors, RLUSD doesn’t just aim to compete—it seeks to disrupt. Its integration with regulated finance gives it an edge that many rivals lack.\n\nXRP remains essential in this narrative. A recent CNF report confirmed that Ripple re-locked 700 million XRP in escrow following large-scale wallet activity.\n\nThis action reinforces long-term confidence and reduces the immediate market supply.\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP [XRP] traded at $2.05, reflecting a 2.49% drop in price over the last 24 hours. However, trading volume soared by 63.28%, reaching $6.82 billion—a strong indicator of active market engagement.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, XRP was trading within a bullish pennant flag, as shown in the latest chart. The token bounced off the $2.0235 key support, signaling potential upward momentum.\n\nIf this breakout materializes, XRP could push toward the next major resistance levels at $2.4580 and $2.9530.\n\nTherefore, XRP’s current setup presents a high-probability opportunity for bulls. Additionally, the RLUSD integration strengthens fundamentals, aligning both assets for sustained growth.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\n"

However, technical and behavioral signals suggest a different narrative might be unfolding.\n\nAt the time of writing, Solana was trading at $118.74, down 4.41% in the last 24 hours. On the chart, Solana was bouncing off a well-defined support zone near $115, forming a clear double bottom pattern.\n\nAdditionally, Solana’s price action was approaching the upper boundary of a descending channel that has constrained it for weeks.\n\nIf bullish momentum drives the price beyond $120, it could trigger fresh upward movement. However, failure to break this level might lead to renewed selling pressure, potentially testing the $110 support once again.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nSocial Volume for Solana has surged, with over 2,285 mentions and social dominance climbing to 14.96%. This spike indicates growing trader interest, potentially driven by the technical setup and whale movement.\n\nMoreover, the rise in discussions often reflects speculative anticipation, which fuels short-term volatility. Therefore, increased social buzz could be an early sign of a breakout attempt or a false rally trap.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThe Binance liquidation heatmap showed heavy liquidation activity, concentrated between $117 and $122. As price dipped into this zone, it triggered long liquidations that accelerated the decline.\n\nHowever, clearing out these over-leveraged positions reduces downside pressure and strengthens price stability. A clean move above $122 could force short positions to close, potentially igniting a rally toward $130.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nSolana’s Open Interest (OI) dropped by 6.05% and was sitting at $4.57 billion at press time. This decline shows that traders are de-risking, likely in response to volatility and uncertain direction.\n\nHowever, falling OI often signals a healthier market structure, as excessive leverage gets flushed out. Therefore, a recovery in price with stable or rising open interest could confirm a more sustainable uptrend.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nGiven the whale’s remaining stake, strong technical rebound, increased social sentiment, and reduced leverage pressure, the move seems strategic rather than fear-driven. The deposit to Binance could be a positioning strategy ahead of anticipated market volatility.\n\nAdditionally, the current momentum indicates that Solana may be gearing up for a breakout if it reclaims key levels.\n\nHowever, caution remains essential, as short-term fluctuations or selling pressure might arise before a definitive move materializes.\n\n"

Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH] saw a sharp 6% decline, falling from $1,934 to $1,797.\n\nThe total crypto market cap sunk by 5.3% to $2.7 trillion, accompanied by a spike in market fear—reflected in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging to an “extreme fear” rating of 25.\n\nAdding to the turmoil, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a $157.8 million outflow, with Ethereum ETFs seeing a $3.6 million withdrawal amid concerns over trade war escalation.\n\nHowever, on the 2nd of April, BTC ETFs saw $218.1 million in inflows, while ETH ETFs faced $51.3 million in outflows as per Farside Investors.\n\nWhile BTC and ETH have since regained some ground, broader market sentiment remains fragile, with risk assets—including equities—experiencing similar turbulence, as the S&P 500 wiped out over $2 trillion in market cap.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm market jitters, cautioning U.S. trading partners against retaliatory tariffs in response to the sweeping trade measures.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Bessent emphasized that the newly imposed tariffs represent the “high end” of the scale, suggesting that refraining from countermeasures could provide a “ceiling” and much-needed certainty for global markets.\n\nHis remarks aimed to prevent an escalating tariff war, which could further destabilize financial markets already reacting to heightened economic uncertainty.\n\nOn the other hand, Daan Crypto Trades said,\n\nSource: Daan Crypto Trades/X\n\nIn fact, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange, also noted,\n\n“Mrkt no likey “Liberation Day”, if $BTC can hold $76.5k btw now and US tax day Apr 15, then we are out of the woods. Don’t get chopped up!”\n\nHowever, despite the tariff shock, on-chain data highlights steady institutional accumulation, while technical patterns signal underlying strength rather than sustained decline.\n\nGrowing political support for digital assets and macroeconomic changes could strengthen Bitcoin’s role as a hedge.\n\nThis reinforces Bitcoin’s importance during times of traditional market instability, positioning it as a valuable asset in uncertain conditions.\n\n"

This decline has coincided with a weakening price trend, stabilizing near $1.8K at press time.\n\nThe sustained decrease in activity highlights a notable reduction in user engagement and transactional volume across the network.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nRecent data also reveals a sharp reduction in Ethereum’s total fees burnt, echoing the downtrend in active addresses and suggesting reduced on-chain activity.\n\nLower burn rates could indicate less network congestion or fewer high-priority transactions, reinforcing decreased usage and network momentum.\n\nEthereum’s Dencun upgrade was heralded as a step toward long-term network sustainability. However, the upgrade’s aftermath has sparked debates, as Ethereum’s total supply has surged.\n\nThe data highlights a stark contrast between the pre-Merge deflationary period — marked by a declining supply — and the post-Merge inflationary trend.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe Merge initially brought optimism with its deflationary benefits, reducing Ethereum’s issuance rate and burning more tokens than were created.\n\nHowever, after the Dencun upgrade, the burn mechanism has struggled to counter inflation due to declining transaction volumes and lower network activity. With fewer fees being burned, the network has returned to inflationary territory.\n\nAlthough the upgrade aimed to strengthen Ethereum’s resilience, it unintentionally exacerbated inflation during a period of reduced on-chain activity.\n\nThis shift has made Ethereum’s post-Merge reality appear misaligned with its original deflationary vision, raising doubts about the long-term effectiveness of the burn mechanism.\n\nIt remains uncertain if future updates, such as the Pectra upgrade planned for the 30th of April, can achieve a better balance between sustainability and inflation control.\n\n"

    "full_content": "# Dogecoin – Can technicals and whales spark a 270% rally for its price?\n\nDouble trouble or double signal?\n\nАвтор: Farah Mirza | Дата: April 3, 2025\n\nWhales just grabbed 220M DOGE as Dogecoin flashed a rare technical signal.\n\nDogecoin [DOGE] was trading at $0.1739 on 02 April, before the full impact of ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs pulled it down by another 2% on the charts.\n\nIn fact, the memecoin is now sitting directly on a technical support that has held on for seven years. This long-term boundary, formed by a rising parallel channel, has defined the memecoin’s price action since 2018.\n\nAccording to Ali Martinez, the latest TD Sequential indicator on the weekly chart just issued a buy signal. Historically, this pattern has preceded major price reversals in crypto markets.\n\nSource: X\n\nIn fact, the buy trigger appeared at the same time as DOGE tested the lower line of its channel. Naturally, it creates a high-probability setup, where two independent signals align.\n\nOn-chain activity seemed to support this technical view too.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nBetween 11 and 25 March, whales acquired 220 million Dogecoin — A net inflow that represented 0.17% of total circulating supply.\n\nThis accumulation occurred while DOGE rose from $0.15 to $0.19 – A 26% gain. It happened as the asset reached the same channel support that has sparked previous rallies.\n\nThe holdings tracked in the chart reflect wallets containing 1M–10M DOGE. Activity in these brackets surged throughout the month.\n\nMoreover, funding rates turned positive near that low, marking a possible inflection.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThe chart data also revealed a strong inverse relationship between funding rates and price trends. In January and March, for instance, spikes in negative funding aligned with sharp declines in DOGE.\n\nConversely, positive funding periods saw temporary price stabilizations.\n\nDespite these fluctuations, however, positive funding rates occurred more frequently than negative ones. This hinted at underlying long interest from larger traders throughout the downturn.\n\nLooking forward, if historical behavior repeats itself, DOGE could target the channel midpoint — Estimated at around $0.65. That would reflect a gain of approximately 270% from its press time price.\n\nHowever, if DOGE fails to hold the $0.16 support, prior patterns would highlight the risk of a 26% to 44% drawdown.\n\nThese downside projections are based on previous “death cross” scenarios that triggered breakdowns from similar positions.\n\n"
