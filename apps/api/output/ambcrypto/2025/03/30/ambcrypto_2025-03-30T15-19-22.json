Assessing…\n\nDipping below the historical rebound zone\n\nАвтор: Adewale Olarinde | Дата: March 30, 2025\n\nBitcoin’s sell-side risk ratio has fallen below 0.1% while MVRV momentum builds, signaling potential price recovery.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] could be gearing up for a fresh rally, with two key on-chain indicators flashing historical reversal signals.\n\nThe latest drop in the sell-side risk ratio and a potential bullish crossover in MVRV momentum are bringing optimism back to the market.\n\nBitcoin’s Ssell-Side Risk Ratio has plunged to 0.086%, its lowest level in months.\n\nHistorically, this metric falling below 0.1% has marked strong bounce-back zones, reflecting suppressed realized profits relative to market cap.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThese low-risk periods often coincide with investors’ hesitation to sell, reducing overhead pressure on price.\n\nThe last time the ratio dipped below this level was during Bitcoin’s correction in September 2024, just before it staged a recovery to new highs in Q4.\n\nCurrently, the ratio is again signaling a limited risk of profit-taking, setting the stage for a possible reversal if buying momentum returns.\n\nThe 70-day MVRV momentum is on the verge of breaking above its moving average, a crossover that has historically confirmed bottom formations.\n\nThe MVRV ratio, which compares market value to realized value, is often used to identify undervaluation zones.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin’s MVRV ratio has remained below the 70-day average for weeks, mirroring the pre-bullish setups observed in late October and January.\n\nA confirmed breakout could act as the final confirmation of a bottom, particularly as the broader macro environment stabilizes.\n\nBitcoin traded around $81,100 at press time, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages at $84,934 and $93,916, respectively.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe inability to reclaim the 50-day MA remains a short-term concern. However, the technical setup and on-chain metrics suggest sellers are exhausted, and accumulation is gradually returning.\n\nIf BTC reclaims $85K, it could unlock bullish momentum toward the $90K psychological barrier. Until then, the market may range, with the current setup favoring accumulation strategies.\n\n"

The current conditions have seen whales turn to selling.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, a Pepe whale has made a massive deposit to exchange.\n\nAs per the report, this whale has sold 150 billion Pepe tokens worth $1.14 million. The whale had spent only $2,184 to buy 1.5 trillion tokens at $43 million in the early stages.\n\nSo far, the whale has sold 1.02 trillion tokens worth $6.6 million.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nBesides these transactions, whales have sold over 2.95 trillion Pepe tokens over the past day, according to IntoTheBlock.\n\nAlthough this is a drop from 4 trillion, selling activity from large holders still remained significantly high.\n\nWhen whales turn to selling an asset, it shows a lack of market confidence, reflecting strong bearishness. This transaction may further dampen the memecoin’s negative perception.\n\nAs expected, such a strong sell-side activity has negatively impacted the memecoin’s price charts. In fact, as of this writing, Pepe was trading at $0.00000719. This marked a 6.5% decline on daily charts.\n\nEqually, the memecoin has dropped on weekly and monthly charts, dropping by 1.2% and 3.87% respectively.\n\nThe continued dip has left long position holders at a loss. As such, a trader who went long on PEPE with 10x leverage is now down over $3.36M, according to Lookonchain.\n\nSource: Tradingview\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto’s analysis, Pepe experienced strong bearish sentiments as sellers dominated the market.\n\nThis was evident by the RSI, which made a bearish crossover over the past day. A bearish crossover here suggests that there’s aggressive selling across all market participants, thus displacing buyers.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nThis sell-side pressure is further evidenced by a positive spot netflow. According to Coinglass data, Pepe’s netflow has turned positive, hitting $1.87 million for the first time in four days.\n\nThis shift implies there’s more exchange inflow than outflows, reflecting strong bearish sentiments.\n\nIn conclusion, Pepe is experiencing strong bearish sentiments as investors close their positions. Therefore, with whales and retailers both selling, it reflects a lack of confidence among all market participants.\n\nWhen these two combine, the memecoin is likely to see more losses on its price charts. Thus, prolonged selling activity could see the memecoin drop below $0.0000070 to $0.0000069.\n\nHowever, a reversal here, with buyers reentering the market, will see the memecoin reclaim $0.0000073.\n\n"

One such concern is the liquidation risk tied to large ETH holdings on MakerDAO.\n\nSource: X\n\nAs the price of ETH fluctuates, the 125,603 ETH (approximately $238M) held by two major whales on Maker is at risk of liquidation.\n\nWith the health rate dropping to 1.07 and critical liquidation prices at $1,805 and $1,787, a further decline in ETH’s price could trigger forced liquidations, potentially impacting market stability.\n\nThe Ethereum daily chart shows a slight recovery after an 8% drop in the last week, trading at $1,841.69 at press time.\n\nThe MACD indicator remains bearish, with the line below the signal line, suggesting ongoing selling pressure. The RSI at 36.45 indicated oversold conditions, hinting at a potential reversal if buying volume increases.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe recent price action shows a consolidation phase after a sharp decline, with support likely around $1,750-$1,700. If bullish momentum builds, resistance is expected near $1,900-$2,000.\n\nThe overall trend remains uncertain, with further downside possible unless a strong buying push materializes.\n\n"

One key concern is weak DeFi activity, which remains below pre-election levels. This suggests that on-chain engagement has yet to recover.\n\nOn top of that, with market uncertainty in play, many traders are unstaking SOL, adding to potential selling pressure.\n\nA whale recently unstaked 60,298 SOL at $127, reinforcing this level as a strong supply zone and a potential distribution point.\n\nConsequently, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending downward, but it hasn’t yet reached oversold levels.\n\nThis suggests that selling momentum could continue unless the broader market experiences a fresh capital influx. Hence, Solana remains vulnerable to another corrective move.\n\nSource: TradingView (SOL/USDT)\n\nSolana’s struggles across key metrics suggest that a local bottom may not be in yet.\n\nWhat’s surprising is that this comes right after BlackRock’s massive $1.7 billion investment in Solana’s BUIDL initiative, showing that bullish news hasn’t sparked a strong recovery.\n\nAdding to the concern, the SOL/BTC pair has hit a two-year low on the daily chart. The consistent formation of lower lows signals a shift in investor preference, suggesting that capital is flowing elsewhere.\n\nWith bullish momentum lacking, the 3.71 million in leveraged positions on the 12-hour derivatives chart face an elevated risk of liquidation should SOL retest the $124.91 support level.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nA 32.54% contraction in Solana’s trading volume to $2.05 billion further diminishes the probability of a strong bullish defense, reinforcing downside risks.\n\nAdditionally, risk-off sentiment remains elevated as markets brace for the high-stakes tariff decisions set for this week, adding macro uncertainty.\n\nAs Q2 unfolds under heightened volatility, a retracement toward the $110–$115 demand zone appears increasingly probable. Solana traders should thus exercise caution.\n\n"

The Relative Strength Index [RSI] also suggests the asset is not in overbought territory, leaving room for upward movement.\n\nIf XRP fails to hold the support at $2.00, downside risks could emerge, with the next support zones resting near $1.77 and $1.60.\n\nOn-chain data from Santiment reveals that large holders, particularly wallets holding 1,000-10,000,000 XRP, have steadily accumulated through Q1 2025.\n\nThe red and cyan lines on the accumulation chart show a persistent upward trajectory, particularly among the 10,000-100,000 XRP and 1,000,000-10,000,000 XRP cohorts.\n\nMeanwhile, addresses with 1 billion+ XRP have also shown renewed interest, with a sharp uptick around the 29th of March.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThis strategic accumulation during pullbacks reflects growing confidence among high-conviction holders.\n\nHistorically, such behavior often precedes major price movements, especially when aligned with technical consolidation zones.\n\nXRP’s price structure and whale behavior suggest the asset is primed for a breakout; the only question is when. A clean move above the symmetrical triangle resistance could open the floodgates toward $3+ territory.\n\nUntil then, XRP traders and investors should closely watch the $2.00 support zone and volume expansion to confirm directional bias.\n\n"

Is this large sale an indicator of a potential downturn, or could it be a strategic move before a larger market rally?\n\nDespite this whale activity, Solana’s network is showing robust growth. The network recently surpassed an all-time high of 11.12 million addresses holding at least 0.1 SOL.\n\nThis milestone highlights growing adoption and strong interest in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nIt reflects the increasing involvement of retail investors and developers, which could provide long-term support for the network.\n\nTherefore, despite some short-term selling pressure, the overall trajectory for Solana remains positive in the bigger picture.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nIn terms of price action, Solana is currently retesting a key support zone. Traders are closely watching this level to determine if the token will bounce back or break through.\n\nThe chart indicates that the support has historically held strong, which could pave the way for a rebound.\n\nHowever, at press time, SOL is trading at $125.19, showing a 4.99% decline over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis decline has added to concerns about whether Solana can sustain its bullish momentum, or if it will face further price corrections.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nWhen analyzing the Funding Rates across exchanges, it’s clear that the sentiment among traders is mixed. At press time, the Funding Rate for SOL across exchanges is showing a value of 0.002343%.\n\nThis figure suggests that there is a neutral stance in the market, with no overwhelming bias towards long or short positions.\n\nThe fluctuations in the Funding Rate indicate that while traders are not extremely bearish, they are also cautious about making strong bullish moves.\n\nTherefore, the market remains uncertain, waiting for more signals from the price action and broader market trends before committing to a clear direction.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThe recent whale sale of 60,289 SOL tokens may have sparked concerns about Solana’s short-term outlook. However, the network’s growth, alongside the retesting of key support, suggests that SOL is still in a healthy position.\n\nDespite the price decline and mixed Funding Rates, the fundamental strength of the network and potential for a rebound makes the current situation more of a short-term correction.\n\nTherefore, the whale’s move does not necessarily indicate a downturn; instead, it might be a strategic decision, with a market rally still possible in the near future.\n\n"

Hyperliquid confirmed the decision on March 27 through a tweet on X.\n\nBitget’s Gracy Chen through her recent tweet however condemned the action by comparing the action to the FTX tragedy. She questioned the decentralization of Hyperliquid and the vault management as well.\n\nIn response to this, Hyperliquid made substantial risk management upgrades to enhance security and transparency.\n\nTo prevent future disagreements, Hyperliquid upgraded its blockchain to allow for fully on-chain validator voting for delisting an asset, as announced on their recent tweet.\n\nThe permission less, stake-based mechanism removes off chain coordination. When a quorum of validator stake votes for delisting, the action automatically executes through HyperCore.\n\nTo illustrate the upgrade, validators 2-5 of Hyper Foundation conducted a test vote to delist MYRO perps on the 29th of March.\n\nValidator 1 will continue to abstain until early adopters of the Delegation Program complete their stake distribution. This assures greater fairness and decentralized control.\n\nUsers should expect validators in the future to preview their voting intention for transparency.\n\nFollowing the JELLY incident, Hyperliquid’s  price action has been bearish all along. HYPE price have declined by approximately 28%  since the incident occurrence.\n\nHowever, the bearish pressure has begun to fade, as evident on the daily chart since the implementation of the updated risk management system.\n\nIf the demand zone at around $12.20 remain strong, HYPE bullish reversal could be on cards.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nHYPE Open Interest is sparking revival signals after the sluggish decline during the scandal.

    "full_content": "# Dogecoin’s downward spiral – Can whale accumulation save the memecoin’s price?\n\nWhale accumulation gives a tiny flame of hope for DOGE bulls\n\nАвтор: Akashnath S | Дата: March 30, 2025\n\nDogecoin bulls remain hopeful of defending the $0.14 lows from November.\n\nThe memecoin market has been in down-only mode since December. Most of the popular memecoins, barring Dogecoin [DOGE] and Shiba Inu [SHIB], have erased most or all of their gains from the past nine months.\n\nThis trend is due to the flood of memecoins in the market. Since memes depend on market hype rather than fundamentals, it has been difficult for bulls to drive gains for meme tokens.\n\nSource: DOGE/USDT on TradingView\n\nDogecoin’s 1-day price chart exhibited a clear downtrend with its series of lower highs and lower lows since late January. In fact, DOGE has fallen to near its November lows at $0.142. Although its OBV was not diving lower, the downtrend was visible. The MACD also outlined bearish momentum since February.\n\nAMBCrypto examined other metrics to understand if investors should buy near the $0.14-$0.15 lows from November, hoping for a rally in the coming months.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThe supply in profit (as a percentage) has been falling since December. This mirrored the price action, as it should. The metric has fallen from 99.44% on 8 December to 70.95% at press time.\n\nThe 90-day MVRV ratio was also deeply negative, with a reading of 38.14%. Together, the metrics underlined the bearish viewpoint the price chart explored earlier.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nExamination of the supply distribution can illuminate if the whales were accumulating or distributing their Dogecoin. The metric revealed that the 100k-1M DOGE cohort has been on a slow downtrend in recent months. Figures for the same saw a minor uptick in March, but fell again over the past month.\n\nOn the contrary, smaller wallets have been accumulating. More interestingly, and with more potential for market impact, is the 1M-10M DOGE holding cohort. These wallets have increased their DOGE holdings since 7 March. This, despite they recording a minor dip in recent days too.\n\nHere, it must be noted that Dogecoin is inflationary, meaning more Dogecoin is entering the supply over time. And yet, some accumulation among the whales is a slightly hopeful sign.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nOn the other hand, the long-term holder net unrealized profit/loss (LTH NUPL) was rather bleak at press time. It had a value of 0.4, translating to “anxiety” according to the chart. The metric roughly went along the same trends as the first half of 2024.\n\nIf the same continues, it could see Dogecoin slump below $0.15 and continue lower in April. A consolidation phase over the summer could be necessary before the bulls have the strength to drive another rally. This was what occurred in July/August of 2024, and something similar might play out in 2025.\n\nThe price action and the NUPL showed that the downtrend has remained in place. Long-term investors need to bide their time and wait for a consolidation phase, one that stretches at least for a few weeks.\n\n"

While three out of the last four instances of such a dip led to declines, there’s a chance that this time might mirror 2020’s market behavior. Back then, the negative shift was part of a broader consolidation phase.\n\nIf this downward trend continues, it could signal the potential for new lows in the near future.\n\nThe 1-year percentage change of Bitcoin tracks its price difference over a rolling 12-month period, serving as a key indicator of market sentiment. When this metric enters the negative zone, it shows that Bitcoin’s price is lower than it was a year ago.\n\nHistorically, this has been linked to bearish momentum, signaling waning buying interest or a hike in selling pressure. In fact, out of the last four instances, three led to sustained downturns, while one had minimal impact.\n\nNow, while the negative zone hinted at reduced volatility and lower risk, it doesn’t always guarantee further losses. External factors also play a role.\n\nAlphractal’s chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 1-year percentage change, alongside price movements, marked four key periods when the metric dipped below zero.\n\nThe first instance in 2015 was a brief dip during recovery from 2014’s bear market. The longest negative phase occurred between 2018 and 2019 after Bitcoin fell from $20,000 to around $3,200. A short negative period in 2020 was linked to COVID-19 market disruptions, while the most recent episode in 2022 followed the drop from $69,000 to below $20,000.\n\nSource: Alphractal\n\nIt is March 2025 now and Bitcoin’s 1-year percentage change is nearing zero – A sign og potential movement into the negative zone. Analysts are divided on whether this indicates a consolidation phase or the risk of a new bearish cycle.\n\nAmid concerns over Bitcoin approaching the aforementioned negative zone, the 2020 consolidation offers an optimistic example.\n\nBack then, Bitcoin’s 1-year change turned negative, but it didn’t lead to a prolonged downturn. Instead, it signaled a period of consolidation before a major bullish breakout. The current situation mirrors this, with Bitcoin’s price remaining steady near the negative zone.\n\nIf history repeats itself, the market may see short-term stagnation before resuming its upward momentum.\n\nBitcoin’s 1-year percentage change moving into the negative zone could signal a further decline on the charts. Previous instances show sustained negative movement often correlates with bearish trends, indicating lost momentum.\n\nIf the metric drops below zero, it may suggest the rally has stalled, prompting a risk-off approach.\n\nExternal factors could deepen this downturn. Prolonged negativity may pressure Bitcoin to retest support levels, triggering panic selling and a deeper bear cycle.\n\n"
