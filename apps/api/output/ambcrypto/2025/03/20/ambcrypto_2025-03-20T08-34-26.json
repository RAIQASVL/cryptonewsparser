    "full_content": "# Shiba Inu’s price may be near a breakout – Traders, watch out for these levels!\n\nSHIB’s technical setup – What do the indicators tell us?\n\nАвтор: Denis Mwirigi | Дата: March 20, 2025\n\nEveryone’s second favourite memecoin is in an interesting position on the charts.\n\nPopular memecoin Shiba Inu has struggled to record any significant price recovery following a sustained downtrend since the start of the year. However, at the time of writing, SHIB saw its price rise by 2.20% as trader participation and Open Interest surged across the board.\n\nAt the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.00001255. Thanks to a high correlation to Bitcoin’s price movement and the anticipated hike in network adoption, can SHIB mimic Bitcoin’s recovery efforts?\n\nSHIB’s technical indicators revealed a bullish momentum in the short term, while the memecoin’s long-term strength remains in question. At the time of writing, SHIB was consolidating inside a falling wedge pattern, indicative of a potential bullish trend reversal.\n\nAccording to Crypto Sat on CoinMarketCap, a breakout above the $0.00001260 key resistance level on its descending trendline could trigger a price uptrend. SHIB’s price could rally towards $0.00001280 in the short term, while eyeing $ 0.00001320 in the mid-term.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nSHIB’s 24-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) stood at 43 and rose to 51 on the 4-hour timeframe too. This seemed to be indicative of heightened buying pressure in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe memecoin’s MACD level (12,26) and momentum highlighted bullish momentum. Similarly, the short-term and long-term moving averages flashed ‘buy’ at press time. On the contrary, the long-term moving averages signaled ‘sell’ – A sign of existing bearish pressure evident from a low long-short ratio (0.87).\n\nThe memecoin market has been extremely speculative lately, without sparing even established meme oins such as Shiba Inu. Several market developments could be fuelling SHIB’s bullish short-term momentum.\n\nFor instance,  Shibarium, the memecoin’s layer-2 blockchain, is on the verge of a 10 million block milestone. According to Shiba Inu team member Lucie on X (formerly Twitter), the growing SHIB community is also anticipating SHIB OS.\n\nThe OS is a solution for enterprises and governments transitioning to secure decentralized governance models and real-world blockchain utility. Thanks to these and other market developments, SHIB’s bullish momentum could strengthen and sustain an uptrend in the mid-term.\n\n74% of SHIB is controlled by whales, as per IntoTheBlock data. Most of the holders (60%) have held for more than a year at losses, hoping for a price rebound.\n\nThe surge in large transactions over the past week. alongside market developments, may be indicative of greater whale activity associated with a price upsurge. With a rising Open Interest(+5.63%) and a high Bitcoin correlation, SHIB’s movement could follow BTC’s price recovery.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nIf SHIB’s bullish momentum is sustained, a breakout could rally towards the $0.00001280-$0.00001320 key resistance zone.\n\nConversely, if the bears pull further, the $0.00001220 support could be tested as price consolidation continues. One should watch for whale activity and market developments alongside these key levels.\n\n"

    "full_content": "# Ethereum climbs above $2,000, but could a price drop be coming soon?\n\nPiecing together the clues for Ethereum\n\nАвтор: Akashnath S | Дата: March 20, 2025\n\nPrice action and on-chain metrics revealed that ETH’s latest bounce would be followed by a sizeable drop.\n\nEthereum [ETH] saw a 10% price bounce since Tuesday’s lows. Such a bounce ahead of the U.S. Fed Meeting appeared ominous, but there were no unexpected revelations. The economic growth has been slower than expected for the current year, with the same expected for next year. Also, the Federal Reserve signaled two rate cuts this year, with a more uncertain outlook.\n\nThis is not terrible news for the crypto market, with Bitcoin [BTC] bouncing to $87.5k before seeing a 1.86% retracement at press time. Ethereum was down 2.36% from its previous day’s high at $2,069. In fact, a recent report noted that Ethereum’s network activity was at its lowest in 2025 – A warning sign for investors.\n\nSource: ETH/USDT on TradingView\n\nOn the 1-day chart, ETH maintained a strong bearish trajectory. The OBV was below local highs, although the RSI appeared to signal a bullish shift. The move beyond $2k appeared to be a statement, but it could also be a liquidity hunt.\n\nGiven the structure, it may be likely that the price would head lower once again. The buying volume necessary to drive a bullish structure shift was not yet here, according to the OBV. Market sentiment was also broadly fearful at press time.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nExchange netflows track the flow of ETH into and out of all exchanges. It is the difference between inflows and outflows, and the 7-day moving average to smooth out variance. Higher inflows imply more selling pressure, while hike in outflows imply accumulation among market participants.\n\nSince mid-January, there have been four notable spikes in ETH inflows to exchanges. Local peaks in netflows were seen on 24 January,  19 February, 3 March, and 14 March.\n\nThe first three spikes were followed by a sharp price drop within a few days. The early March inflows occurred during Ethereum’s drop from $2.8k to $1.8k.\n\nIf this pattern repeats itself, the worries from the price action front are even more likely to be correct. Bears could initiate another price drop in the coming days.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe taker buy/sell ratio measured the taker (market order) buy volume to sell volume in perpetual trades. A ratio over 1 meant taker buy orders were dominant – Indicating bullish sentiment.\n\nOver the past three weeks, bearishness has been prevalent. The taker ratio showed selling pressure was stronger. It began to change over the past two days, which in turn saw the 7-EMA (purple) climb above 1.\n\nThis ascent was short-lived though. At press time, the 7-EMA of the taker ratio was negative once again, outlining the possibility of a price drop. Combined with the clues from the price action and the exchange netflows, it may be likely that Ethereum would fall to $1,750 or lower.\n\n"

This might position Canada as a potential blockchain powerhouse.\n\nWith Canada’s pro-crypto momentum accelerating, the prospect of a national Bitcoin reserve is becoming increasingly tangible.\n\nThe country’s abundant hydropower offers a strategic advantage for Bitcoin mining. Additionally, institutional adoption—evident in pension fund diversification—adds pressure for regulatory action.\n\nAs Texas strengthens its Bitcoin position, Canada may be poised to rival the United States in digital asset leadership.\n\nWith market infrastructure already in place and political will aligning, Canada’s emergence as a global crypto powerhouse might be inevitable.\n\nWhile Pierre Poilievre once held a commanding 92% chance of victory on Polymarket, his odds have now adjusted to 48% – Sgnaling a more competitive landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Carney has emerged as a strong contender, currently leading with 53% odds.\n\nDespite this shift, however, Poilievre’s pro-crypto stance continues to resonate with investors and policymakers. This keeps the prospect of a Bitcoin-friendly Canada very much alive.\n\nSimply put, as the election draws nears, the outcome will shape the country’s digital asset future and its position in the global crypto economy.\n\n"

As per a report, the malware ‘StilachiRAT’ has remote access to PCs, enabling it to scan and steal users’ credentials, including digital wallets.\n\nSome of the wallets vulnerable to the malware include Phantom, Bitget, Trust, MetaMask, BNB Chain, OKX, Sui, and Coinbase wallets, among others.\n\nHere, it’s worth pointing out that while Microsoft noted that the malware didn’t have a massive footprint, its stealth capabilities are worth monitoring. This, to help users protect their crypto assets.\n\nSolana-based Phantom Wallet has already acknowledged the threat and cautioned its users to adopt extra measures. Users have been advised to use password managers, update their anti-virus, and avoid copy-pasting private keys.\n\nLast month, Bybit lost $1.5 billion to a security breach linked to North Korean threat actors. In fact, this accounted for half of the reported lost funds in 2024, according to data compiled by Web3 security firm PeckShield.\n\nSource: PeckShield\n\nAs per PeckShield’s data, hacks have accounted for 70% of total lost funds over the past year, compared to scams. This means that users have been more susceptible to security breaches than Ponzi schemes.\n\nBesides, less than $500M of the lost +$3 billion crypto funds in 2024 were recovered. Simply put, early prevention and safety measures are necessary because recovery efforts could be tenuous and unlikely in some cases.\n\n"

However, the selling pressure might not last long.\n\nThe strong uptrend and demand were likely to make only a minor retracement before the next leg higher.\n\nEOS [EOS] was another major winner, gaining 37.87% from Tuesday’s low at $0.487 to the high at $0.67. EOS had a larger market cap, but the two tokens were among the biggest winners of the past 24 hours.\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed their price charts to see what their next trends could be.\n\nSource: BMT/USDT on TradingView\n\nThe 2-hour BMT chart showed a strong uptrend in progress. Although the token was retracing at press time, the structure remained bullish.\n\nMoreover, the small market cap of the coin meant any gains made could be quick and explosive.\n\nInvestors with high conviction can use the Fibonacci retracement levels plotted in the chart above to bid on the BMT token. The OBV has not sunk noticeably, even though the coin fell below the 38.2% level at $0.235.\n\nHence, there was a good chance that a recovery would be quick, once the retracement is over.\n\nSource: EOS/USDT on TradingView\n\nThe price action of EOS on the 2-hour chart showed strong bullishness. Even though the token has retraced more than 50% of the recent gains, the RSI remained above neutral 50.\n\nThe OBV has not plummeted below the recent lows, either. Hence, there was hope that EOS bulls would defend the next retracement levels at $0.558 and $0.527- but this would be a false hope.\n\nSource: EOS/USDT on TradingView\n\nEOS has a strong bearish structure on the 1-day chart. The recent rally drove the price just above the recent lower high at $0.647.\n\nHence, the move was likely a liquidity grab and a false breakout. It appeared more likely that EOS would continue to trend downward.\n\nTraders must maintain their bearish bias despite the recent gains. On the other hand, a daily session close above $0.647 would flip the structure bullishly and indicate further gains were likely.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer’s opinion\n\n"

This upward momentum is a strong technical indicator for dip buyers and whales to enter.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nConsequently, the activity concentration data from IntoTheBlock indicated that 44% of addresses pushing the market activity leant on the whales.\n\nWith an increasing overall whale activity, ETH price rally to test the flag pattern seems inevitable.

The volume indicator gave some hope to new buyers, but holders experiencing losses have little reason to cheer.\n\nSource: DOT/USDT on TradingView\n\nThe DOT market structure on the daily was bearish. The swing high at $5.25 was the level for the price to beat before it could make a market structure break.\n\nThere was some local resistance at the $4.5 region that could oppose the buyers.\n\nThe MACD formed a bullish crossover, but it was still below the zero line, showing the momentum was predominantly bearish. On the other hand, the A/D indicator has made higher lows since February.\n\nUnlike the price action of Polkadot, the A/D indicator was slowly trending higher, although it hasn’t breached the December highs.\n\nThis was a slight encouragement. It showed that the trading volume during the heavy retracement was lesser than it had been during the volume surge on the way up.\n\nThe flip side was that many of the DOT buyers from that rally were facing losses, and could be eager to get out at breakeven.\n\nTherefore, breaching the resistances to the north such as $5.38 and $6.72 could be a difficult battle.\n\nSource: DOT/USDT on TradingView\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, things looked slightly more encouraging for the bulls. The sub-structure was bullish and Polkadot has made higher lows over the past five days. The key level to breach on this timeframe was at $4.62.\n\nA move beyond this level would shift the 4-hour swing structure bullishly.

Historically, the launch of regulated futures contracts has paved the way for spot ETF approvals.\n\nPer the chart below by AMBCrypto, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) previously approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs only after their respective Futures had established a regulated price discovery mechanism.\n\nSource: AMBCrypto\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts estimate a 70% chance of SOL ETF approval by year-end.\n\nSolana’s Futures launch reflects cautious market sentiment, with mixed signals across exchanges.\n\nOn-chain activity shows volatility, while analysts see a fast-tracked ETF approval likely by late 2025, reinforcing its growing institutional appeal.\n\n"

However, analysts believe $0.29 may be achievable in the short term.\n\nThe prediction hinges on DOGE’s proximity to the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which could act as a support level for future price movement.\n\nTraders are closely monitoring this level for signs of stability, which might indicate a potential rally. However, if DOGE fails to break above the EMA, further declines could follow.\n\nAccording to Igor Bondarenko, if DOGE struggles to gain momentum at this level, the price may drop as low as $0.10, presenting a bearish scenario for the cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the time of writing, the MACD indicator was showing a bearish trend for Dogecoin. The MACD line (blue) was below the signal line (orange), suggesting a lack of upward momentum.\n\nAdditionally, the histogram remains mostly negative, reinforcing the prevailing weakness in the market.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe RSI was at 36.97, just below the neutral 50 mark. This level suggests that DOGE is in the oversold region, which might signal further selling pressure if it continues to drop below 30.\n\nIf the RSI remains under 40, the market could experience continued weakness, potentially leading to further corrections.\n\nDespite the bearish signals, Dogecoin’s network has shown increased activity. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, there has been a notable surge in active addresses, rising from 150,000 on the 12th of March to over 280,000 by the 14th of March.\n\nSource: X\n\nThe spike in activity coincided with a price increase from $0.16 to $0.26, suggesting that higher network participation drove demand.\n\nHowever, the price later retraced, indicating that the initial enthusiasm waned.\n\nAdditionally, large transactions surged as whales bought over 110 million DOGE within a week. This influx of major players supported a short-term bullish trend but also hinted that some buying pressure was temporary.\n\nThe subsequent price retracement suggests that profit-taking or market corrections may have influenced the downturn.\n\nSource: X\n\nAs Dogecoin moves through this phase of uncertainty, key resistance and support levels are crucial. The price reached $0.202 on the 6th of March, which remains a strong resistance level.\n\nA break above this level could signal a continuation of the bullish trend, but failure to do so may lead to further consolidation or declines.\n\nOn the downside, $0.18 has emerged as a critical support level for Dogecoin. If the price breaks below this level, it could suggest a bearish market shift and lead to further downside pressure.\n\nFinally, as the market remains volatile, the coming days will be crucial in determining Dogecoin’s next major move.\n\n"

One pseudonymous market analyst, Wazz Crypto, stated,\n\n“This id*ot is making Bitcoin uninvestable at this point. Can it even be digital gold anymore if it’s tied to the solvency of a single company?”\n\nAnother user, Simon Dixon, termed it a ‘next-level risk’ that could require a bailout if it goes under.\n\n“Strategy’s announcement of a perpetual 10% dividend paid in dollars—despite lacking sufficient dollar revenue & operating with a Bitcoin-based balance sheet—is next-level risk.”\n\nHowever, Bitmex Research clarified that the firm could avoid paying MSTR and STRF holders dividends.\n\n“Seems $MSTR can avoid paying these 10% to 18% dividends “for any reason.” The likely outcome here is class A $MSTR shareholders never ever get a dividend payment.”\n\nSource: X\n\nFor his part, long-term BTC critic Peter Schiff termed the new stock issuance ‘ridiculous’ and added,\n\n“The only thing keeping it (BTC) from deflating completely is the Trump administration’s support. Once that goes, it’s all over for Bitcoin and $MSTR.”\n\nCompared to last quarter, the firm’s BTC buying pace has slowed in 2025. On 16th March, it bought 130 BTC, increasing its stash to 499,226 coins – A 2.3% control of total BTC supply.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nAs of this writing, MSTR was valued at $282, down 48% from its recent highs of $543, following recent BTC losses. In the past two weeks, it fluctuated between $230 and $300 as BTC remained below $90K over the same period.\n\nOn a year-to-date (YTD) performance, MSTR held the risk-off sentiment better and was down only 5% compared to BTC’s 11% decline.\n\nSource: MSTR vs BTC, TradingView\n\nLast week, MSTR posted a 26% gain as BTC retested $85K, suggesting the stock could post a strong recovery if the cryptocurrency reversed its losses.\n\n"
