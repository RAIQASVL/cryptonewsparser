BTC’s decline followed Nasdaq’s 2% drop. However, gold jumped to a new high, reiterating investors’ risk-off mode and macro uncertainty, especially ahead of President Trump’s new tariffs.\n\nAccording to Coinbase analysts, the crypto’s price could remain range-bound ($78k-$88k) until then. They stated,\n\n“We anticipate range-bound trading at least until April 2nd, the deadline for President Trump’s tariffs.”\n\nThe analysts further warned that April-June have been “tough months” for crypto on a seasonal basis. They suggested reduced exposure as a great strategy.\n\nThe cautious outlook was also evident on-chain, as per the financial distress faced by short-term holders (STH). These are new investors (top buyers) who’ve held BTC for less than six months and likely bought the asset above $90k or $100k.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the supply held by STHs hit a 7-year high loss of 3.4 million BTC.\n\n“Recent downside volatility has created strenuous conditions for new investors, with the volume of Short-Term Holder supply held in loss surging to a massive 3.4M BTC. This is the largest volume of STH supply in loss since July 2018.”\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThe analytics firm added that the prevailing pressure could heighten the “probability of a market-wide capitulation event.”\n\nEven Options traders seemed to be positioned for further downside risk scenarios in the short term. According to Amderdata’s 25-delta risk reversal (25RR) indicator, for instance, Options expiries for 04 April (-7.41) and 11 April (-6.0) were negative, at the time of writing.\n\nSource: Amberdata\n\nThis hinted at an uptick in hedging activity and more demand for put options (bearish bets) for the next two weeks. Simply put, speculators are expecting potential dips in early April.\n\nWorth noting, however, that it may not be all gloomy. When zoomed out on the weekly price charts, BTC defended the weekly 50-EMA (exponential moving average, 1W50EMA). This dynamic level was a key support in the past bull runs of 2021 and is also one in the current 2023-2025 cycle.\n\nSource: BTC/USD, TradingView\n\nSimply put, Bitcoin’s overall market structure is still bullish. However, if a sustained break below 1W50EMA occurs, the asset could be deemed to be in a bearish trend – A warning shot to bulls.\n\nSo, it’s a key level to watch in Q2.\n\n"

In fact, at the time of writing, despite losses on the 24-hour front, BTC was still holding on to the $83,000-level. These figures can be expected to contribute to the crypto-market’s increasing adoption and positive institutional news.\n\nThat’s not all though. Especially since the latest institutional update involves GameStop announcing that it will now hold BTC as a reserve treasury asset.\n\nThanks to the same, its Open Interest climbed to a new all-time high of $61.17 billion – A sign of heightened market activity and a sustained bullish run.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nGameStop’s move signals growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin, a trend that could further solidify BTC’s position as a reserve asset. Historically, institutional investments have driven both price and adoption, benefiting the broader crypto market.\n\nIn most cases, as Bitcoin strengthens, altcoins tend to follow, under the helping hand of rising on-chain metrics and improving sentiment.\n\nAt the time of writing, the correlation between Bitcoin and AVAX over the past three months stood at 0.76 – A sign that AVAX’s price could react positively to BTC’s momentum.\n\nLending more weight to the bullish bias, Avalanche network has seen greater adoption lately due to its low-cost transaction fees. This has further sparked traders and developers’ interests.\n\nThis can be evidenced by the hike in AVAX addresses and transactions, with the latter exceeding 200k over the last 6 days.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nAs AVAX’s institutional adoption rises, the larger crypto market could benefit accordingly. AMBCrypto’s analysis of on-chain data revealed that altcoins, including AVAX, are now noting higher transaction volumes and stronger technical indicators.\n\nThanks to BTC’s rising adoption rate, AVAX’s long-term outlook remains generally bullish. If the trend continues, AVAX could gain more momentum, especially given its strong correlation with BTC and the altcoin’s increasing network activity.\n\nAs institutional adoption increases, AVAX could profit and test higher supply zones. The next in line will be the psychological level at around $30, especially if the momentum penetrates the press time resistance zone at around $20.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\n"

According to LookOnChain’s analysis, this resulted in a loss of $3.3 million.\n\nThe whale completed its third unsuccessful sale, thus accumulating $15.7M in losses since buying tokens for profit at first. Needless to say, these losses were a product of not just other sales in the memecoin’s market, but also market-wide price declines triggered by volatility.\n\nSource: Lookonchain\n\nThe sale of TRUMP tokens by this particular holder triggered fear, especially among secondary holders who sold more tokens that intensified the market fall.\n\nMarket recovery, together with the entry of new investors, could stabilize the price of TRUMP, allowing for potential price recovery. However, the price drop could intensify if whales keep exiting the market and scare away minor investors.\n\nA 8% decline was seen on TRUMP/USDT’s charts when it penetrated through its ascending triangle support level which showed higher selling activities. The price position of $10.23 highlighted bearish continuation because the breakdown happened on the charts.\n\nThe price could find resistance at $9.56, with the same corresponding to a previous level of support. The MACD histogram demonstrated worsening negative momentum as the MACD line at -0.24 was below the Signal line located at -0.09. This confirmed an ongoing bear market trend.\n\nThe RSI value of 29.26 reached the oversold zone, suggesting potential stabilization if sellers cannot keep their dominance. Additionally, the structure break at $11.20 canceled out all previous ascent attempts, resulting in downward momentum.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nA price failure at $10.23 could trigger a possible price re-check of $9.56 – A previous demand zone. The price could likely challenge $11.20, followed by $12.50, if it recovers above $10.80 and breaks bearish momentum.\n\nFurther weakness might be likely only if buyers take control of higher prices. Confirmation of bearish momentum could happen if sustained selling pressure resists any expected short-term recovery.\n\nFalling below $10.23 could trigger additional downfall. On the contrary, breaking through $11.20 could test bearish pressure.\n\nSpot flows and the volume heatmap highlighted TRUMP’s activity across cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance led with $70.63M in volume and $148.45K in 12-hour positive net inflows.\n\nBybit followed with figures of $43.1M, OKX with $27.09M, Coinbase with $11.05M and Kraken with $5.08M.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nAs far as inflows were concerned, they were negative with -$1.53M for Coinbase and -$1.53M for Kraken, in addition to -$3.85M for OKX and -$1.04M for Bybit at press time. Strength of demand associated with Binance’s trading underlined positivity about TRUMP’s stability at $10.66.\n\nTo put it simply, the price trend is most likely to be stable with inflows unless selling pressure is compelled by draining funds from other exchanges and falling values. TRUMP investors may be faced with an uncertain position due to this mixed market action. Especially as the memecoin’s price might change depending on the status of its inflows.\n\n"

The report cited comments from top cabinet officials and the Federal Reserve governor.\n\nIn early March, during the White House crypto summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, stated,\n\n“We’re going to put a lot of thought into the stablecoin regime. We’ll keep the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency in the world through stablecoins.”\n\nIn addition, the report added that Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller echoed a similar outlook in February.\n\nAccording to Bessent, stablecoins were a new demand line for U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills), a comment well captured by Tether’s USDT traction.\n\nAccording to Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, the stablecoin issuer was the seventh-largest buyer of U.S. T-bills.\n\nSource: Tether\n\nIn 2024, the firm bought $33 billion worth of T-bills, placing it above Canada and Mexico. USDT is the world’s largest stablecoin backed by U.S. T-bills, cash, and other cash equivalents.\n\nCircle’s USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, also has U.S. T-bills as part of its reserve to ensure a 1:1 peg to the dollar.\n\nOverall, over 99% of the current $234 billion stablecoin market size was dollar-peg versions, further giving the U.S. a vantage point.\n\nBesides, it is now one of the hottest segments in crypto, attracting interest from large and small players, including governments. This week alone, Trump-linked World Liberty Financials launched its stablecoin, USD1, while Fidelity tested a similar product.\n\nOn the cross-border payments side, Paypal, Stripe, Visa, and other banks have made or are planning similar moves.\n\nAccording to Ardoino, the ‘stablecoin multiverse’ was inevitable. To keep up with the traction and offer regulatory clarity, the U.S. Congress has introduced two stablecoin bills, the GENIUS and STABLE Acts.\n\n"

What’s next for Solana?\n\nSolana [SOL] has become the center of attention in the crypto market, riding a fresh wave of optimism fueled by institutional interest.\n\nWith BlackRock launching yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on the network and GameStop integrating Bitcoin through Solana’s [SOL] infrastructure, sentiment around SOL has surged to unprecedented levels.\n\nBut will this social momentum translate into a price breakout?\n\nData from Santiment reveals a sharp spike in Solana’s Positive/Negative Sentiment Ratio, climbing to 32.87 – far outpacing sentiment levels around Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Ripple[XRP].\n\nThis sharp divergence underscores a unique bullish tilt for SOL on social platforms, suggesting growing investor confidence.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThe spike coincides with BlackRock’s strategic use of Solana’s infrastructure and GameStop’s broader crypto pivot, both of which have been heavily amplified by influencers and community support.\n\nThis fusion of technological utility and mainstream integration has created the perfect storm for a sentiment-driven rally.\n\nDespite the sentiment frenzy, Solana’s price action is flashing caution. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $132.49, registering a 4.27% intraday dip.\n\nThe 50-day Moving Average (MA) at $133.74 has acted as a key resistance level, while the 200-day MA at $183.04 loomed far above, highlighting how much ground SOL needs to reclaim for a true trend reversal.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nAt press time, the Bollinger Bands were tightening, reflecting contracting volatility.\n\nMeanwhile, the Average True Range (ATR) sat at 6.18, suggesting that SOL remains in a low-volatility regime – a potential prelude to an explosive move in either direction.\n\nSOL’s price pattern indicates consolidation rather than a breakout despite the overly bullish sentiment among traders. This disparity suggests a potential disconnect between emotional optimism and technical resistance levels.\n\nHistorically, such euphoria can be risky, especially when unsupported by volume and price action.\n\nHowever, Solana’s robust developer ecosystem and real-world applications in tokenized finance, like BlackRock’s recent initiative, offer solid fundamentals.\n\nIf SOL surpasses the $140 mark and turns its short-term resistance into support, a rapid upward movement could follow, fueled by persistent social sentiment.\n\n"

This suggests that many expect the price to rise in the short term.\n\nA high concentration of long positions may indicate overconfidence in the market.\n\nHowever, if Dogecoin falls short of traders’ expectations, this could trigger forced liquidations, adding further downward pressure.\n\nAs a result, despite the optimistic outlook, the market may experience heightened volatility.\n\nAt press time, Dogecoin was trading at $0.1809, showing a 7.96% drop in the last 24 hours. The price action suggests that Dogecoin is testing a critical support zone around this level.\n\nIf this support holds, Dogecoin could break through resistance at $0.208 and start a potential rally.\n\nHowever, if the price fails to maintain the support, it could face deeper declines. Therefore, traders should watch this key level closely, as it will determine whether the price trend remains bullish or if a bearish reversal is imminent.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nLooking at Dogecoin’s network activity, the daily active addresses and transaction count remain relatively low. As of the 28th of March 2025, the network shows 47,577 active addresses and just 14,020 transactions.\n\nThis indicates that user engagement is not particularly strong at the moment, which can limit the potential for sustained price growth.\n\nTherefore, without increased demand or activity, Dogecoin might struggle to break free from its current range despite bullish expectations in the futures market.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThe liquidation data reveals that long positions are dominating the liquidations. At the time of writing, $5.53 million in long positions were liquidated compared to just $421,680 in short positions.\n\nThis indicates that the market is under pressure, with long traders facing forced exits as the price struggles to increase.\n\nThe dominance of long liquidations suggests that the market is more vulnerable to a further decline rather than a surge in the short term.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nThe MVRV ratio for Dogecoin was at 0.546, indicating that the market price is slightly overvalued compared to its realized value.\n\nThis suggests that the price may struggle to rise significantly without an increase in demand.\n\nWithout new catalysts or increased investor interest, Dogecoin may face resistance at higher price levels. Therefore, unless there is a shift in market sentiment, the price may continue to consolidate or experience downward pressure.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nDespite the bullish sentiment reflected in the Long-to-Short Ratio, the substantial liquidation of long positions points to increased bearish pressure.\n\nThe current technical levels, coupled with the overvaluation indicated by the MVRV ratio, suggest that Dogecoin may struggle to surge in price.\n\nTherefore, while the market sentiment is largely optimistic, the significant liquidation of long positions and weak market engagement suggest that Dogecoin’s price surge is unlikely in the immediate term.\n\n"

Notably, the funds were transferred to two different wallets.\n\nHistorically, high-value BTC transactions by governments have prompted short-term price fluctuations. While such transactions reflect liquidation plans, direct confirmation of any outright selling has not been observed yet.\n\nHowever, the metrics remain volatile as the market reacts to the transaction.\n\nBitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are at a turning point. AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant data shows record weekly outflows as institutions adjust their portfolios.\n\nMacroeconomic uncertainty has prompted risk-averse investors to reduce BTC exposure and balance their holdings.\n\nThis shift has led to a decline in Bitcoin ETF holdings, signaling potential short-term volatility.\n\nInstitutions may be hedging their crypto investments against broader economic risks, which could impact BTC’s price movements in the weeks ahead.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe impact of the recent Bitcoin movement is evident on the charts. Over the past 24 hours alone, BTC prices have dropped by over 2%, at press time.\n\nThis decline is rubbing shoulders with ETF outflows and the U.S. government’s Bitcoin transfer, which is concerning traders.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nDespite the recent dip, Bitcoin’s overall trend remains bullish, driven by strong fundamentals and increasing adoption. BTC prices have shown resilience in recent months, maintaining their status as a leading financial asset.\n\nAlthough short-term volatility persists, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin appears promising. As institutional investors adjust their strategies, BTC’s price behavior is likely to remain influenced by macroeconomic factors.\n\nMarket consensus suggests a steady trend continuation unless affected by significant external events. Participants should monitor institutional flows and government actions involving Bitcoin to better understand price direction.\n\n"

If market participants across the board continue to sell, losses will intensify.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the U.S. government has sold a massive amount of ETH in the market—884.33 ETH worth $1.77 million at the time of the trade.\n\nA notable sell-off from large investors like the U.S. government, which holds 59,965 ETH in its balance, typically indicates a lack of confidence in the asset and tends to negatively influence the broader market.\n\nSource: Arkham Intelligence\n\nTo understand the impact of this, AMBCrypto studied the U.S. government’s past ETH sales and their effects on the market.\n\nTypically, the U.S. government sells when the market is already declining, which is the current case. Unlike before, ETH might not see a bounce back.\n\nOn three past occasions—August 5, October 1, and October 24—the U.S. government sold 299.95, 74.5, and 177.89 ETH, respectively. Each time, the asset declined to a key support level at $2,348.43, which acted as a catalyst for a bounce back.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nHowever, this time is different. ETH is currently trading below this support level, forming a series of lower lows. If selling pressure intensifies, ETH risks dropping below $1,754. If it fails to bounce back from this level, further decline is likely.\n\nAMBCrypto’s further analysis found that a continued decline could be the current market trend, as retail sentiment toward the asset has hit a new low—a level last seen a year ago.\n\nSource: Google Trend\n\nThis was confirmed by Google search interest over time, which shows that retail search interest in ETH has dropped significantly, a sign often attributed to selling.\n\nThe U.S. government’s sell-off has forced retailers in the country to start selling aggressively. According to the Coinbase Premium Index, which tracks this behavior, this is the first time since the 23rd of March that this cohort of traders is selling.\n\nThis is evident whenever the index is in negative territory. At press time, it had a reading of -0.0016, indicating that selling pressure is gradually mounting.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nInstitutional investors holding approximately $8.83 billion worth of Ethereum as assets under management have also continued selling since the start of March, adding downward pressure to the asset.\n\nBetween the 3rd of March and now, a total of $402.6 million worth of Ethereum has been sold.\n\nIf institutional investors continue to sell, ETH could reach the target level of $1,754, as indicated on the chart.\n\n"

Instead, it registered a slight decline of 4.74% – A move that can be associated with large holders selling across the market.\n\nHowever, according to AMBCrypto, this sell-off may only temporary. Especially since several bullish indicators seemed to hint at a short-term hike for the altcoin.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, large investors have continued to sell AAVE – A move that can be associated with potential profit-taking.\n\nA total of approximately 4,500 AAVE, worth $830,000, was sold by these investors to the market. Such a sale, by default, tends to lead to a price decline on the charts.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nAnd yet, despite these sell-offs, there has been massive buying activity in the spot market. At the time of writing, these spot traders had acquired nearly four times the selling pressure, purchasing $2.39 million worth of AAVE over the last four days.\n\nThis was confirmed as the exchange netflows turned negative during this period. A negative reading means traders aren’t just buying, but are likely to hold for the long term as they move AAVE. In this case, to private wallets.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe bullish sentiment was further confirmed as the large holders’ netflows to exchange turned negative, with a reading of -0.08%. When this happens, it implies that retailers are more dominant in the market.\n\nCombined with the earlier buying activity, it can be seen as a sign that these retailers are dominating through their buying activity.\n\nAt press time, AAVE had become the most valuable protocol in the market, with a TVL value of $18.433 billion. Thanks to its latest uptick, it now holds a $450 million lead over Lido.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nAAVE’s growth confirmed the massive flow of liquidity into the asset and the potential for a major market rally. Especially since AAVE buying is expected to soar in the coming days.\n\nUnlike the spot market which highlighted clear accumulation by traders, derivative market traders have been flashing completely bearish signals.\n\nFor example – Open Interest climbed over the last few days, with the same valued at $239.12 million at press time. This underlined a hike in the number of unsettled contracts across the market.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nAs a standalone metric, it doesn’t provide clear insights into what to expect from derivative traders. However, it can be combined with the rising selling volume and the long-to-short ratio dropping to 0.909. Here, a reading below 1 implies that sellers are dominating – Indicative of a bearish trend.\n\nConcurrently, the funding rate also turned negative, implying that short traders have been paying a premium fee occasionally to maintain their positions. This has contributed to downward pressure on the price charts.\n\n"

Recently, the network has seen more activity compared to other major networks.\n\nThis consistent demand provides a price floor, helping it avoid the deeper drawdowns seen in other crypto market caps.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nAs the market’s flagship asset, BTC continues to act as a bellwether. Its drawdown recovery has remained relatively steady despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and changes in risk appetite.\n\nETH and SOL were facing heavier losses on the other end of the spectrum. At press time, Ethereum was down by 51.1% from its ATH, while Solana has shed 57.5% of its value.\n\nThis suggests that these networks are still grappling with structural headwinds despite intermittent rallies, such as scalability concerns in ETH and lingering FTX-related sentiment in SOL.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nWhile both assets are backed by strong developer communities and high transaction volumes, their market caps have struggled to reclaim previous peaks.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum’s market cap sat at approximately $241.68 billion, while Solana trailed further at $73 billion, as shown in CoinMarketCap and CryptoQuant charts.\n\nRegarding overall dominance, BTC leads the crypto market cap pack with $1.73 trillion, followed by ETH, BNB, and SOL.\n\nNotably, while BNB and SOL share similar market caps, their trajectories have diverged. BNB remains close to its peak levels, while SOL has been unable to break past resistance.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nMeanwhile, stablecoins are experiencing renewed demand, now comprising over $219 billion of the total crypto market, with 2.74% growth in the past month.\n\nThis suggests a cautious approach by investors, possibly waiting for clearer momentum before rotating back into volatile assets.\n\nBNB and BTC’s relative resilience in a choppy market reflects both investor confidence and embedded utility. In contrast, ETH and SOL face a steeper climb to reclaim their former highs.\n\nAs macroeconomic uncertainty continues and capital rotates selectively, the gap between strong and weak performers in the crypto market cap could widen further.\n\n"
