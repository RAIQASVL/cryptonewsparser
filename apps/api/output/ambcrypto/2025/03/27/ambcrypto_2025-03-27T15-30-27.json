According to Spot On Chain, a newly created wallet withdrew 500B PEPE worth $4.3M from Binance.\n\nA few hours earlier, the analytics firm also noted that an early PEPE buyer, who minted 110% on the memecoin, was bidding again. He withdrew 506.2B tokens worth $4.4M, increasing his long bet to 699.8B ($5.11M).\n\nAMBCrypto established that PEPE whale activity exploded triple-digit to 170% this week as they scooped a whopping 14.5 trillion tokens.\n\nThe impact of large players was evident on the price chart. PEPE was up 63% from March lows of $0.0000056.\n\nHowever, the memecoin was still far away from its record high of $0.000028, which it hit last December.\n\nIn fact, PEPE tanked over 80% during Q1 drawdowns, and current levels had reduced the decline to about 70%. Simply put, those who bought the top were still in maximum pain.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nBut could the renewed whale interest extend recovery? Well, key demand signals like social volume and address activity were still low, per Santiment data.\n\nIn addition, the recent positive sentiment retreated to a neutral level, suggesting that the market could go either way.\n\nSource: Coinalyze\n\nOn derivative markets, PEPE’s OI (Open Interest) rates surged from $26M to $50M before easing below $45M at press time.\n\nHowever, spot CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) moved slightly, suggesting the pump might be heavily driven by leverage rather than organic spot demand.\n\nOn the price charts (3-day timeframe), PEPE’s recent 63% pump reversed all its March losses. But bulls were not out of the woods yet.\n\nSource: PEPE/USDT, TradingView\n\nAt the time of writing, price action was below the bull market trendline and 200DMA (daily moving average, blue). A surge above these hurdles would increase the chances of reversing the larger Q1 losses.\n\n"

A new wallet withdrew 7,100 ETH, valued at $14.27 million, from Gemini.\n\nAdditionally, substantial transfers of ETH took place from Binance, OKX, and Kraken, amounting to millions in value.\n\nSome of these assets have been staked or deposited into lending platforms like Aave, which could signal bullish intentions.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was priced at $2,030.76, reflecting a slight 1.21% decline over the past 24 hours.\n\nDespite this minor dip, Ethereum continues to hover above important support levels, especially around $2,000. As whale activity picks up, there is a strong possibility that Ethereum could experience a price rebound.\n\nIf the price stays above this support level, it might break past the $2,100 resistance, potentially triggering a rally.\n\nTherefore, a move above this threshold could spark further buying, and the price could even rise by 37%, approaching $2,800.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum’s Exchange Reserve was at $37.1653 billion, showing a 2.16% decrease recently. This decline suggests that more ETH is moving off exchanges, reducing the liquidity available for immediate trades.\n\nThis shift may indicate that investors are either holding their positions or moving assets to other platforms for staking or long-term investment.\n\nWith a tighter supply on exchanges, Ethereum may experience upward pressure in the coming days.\n\nThe drop in exchange reserves reflects evolving market dynamics and indicates reduced sell-side liquidity, potentially driving price increases.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nBreaking down Ethereum’s liquidation heatmap from Binance reveals key support and resistance zones.\n\nThe map shows significant liquidation points between $2,000 and $2,100. As Ethereum approaches these levels, forced selling could occur, increasing market volatility.\n\nThis increased volatility could either push Ethereum’s price through resistance levels or cause it to face downward corrections.\n\nWith the high number of liquidation points, Ethereum’s price is under pressure but could also surge if the market absorbs these liquidations effectively.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nThe MVRV Long/Short Difference for ETH stood at -16.91 %. This negative value indicates a bearish sentiment among long-term holders. However, such a significant divergence suggests that the market may be oversold.\n\nIf traders perceive this as a buying opportunity, ETH could see a price reversal.\n\nAs more market participants move in to capitalize on the low levels, the price might quickly recover, adding fuel to a potential breakout.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nConsidering Ethereum’s whale activity, key support levels, and market sentiment, it seems likely that ETH is poised for a breakout. The combination of reduced exchange reserves, rising whale activity, and technical indicators suggests upward price momentum.\n\nTherefore, ETH could experience a significant price surge if it breaks past resistance levels, potentially reaching $2,800 soon.\n\n"

    "full_content": "# Mapping Dogecoin’s road ahead – Why DOGE bulls target $0.20 next\n\nURPD reveals a heavy cluster at $0.20\n\nАвтор: Adewale Olarinde | Дата: March 27, 2025\n\nDogecoin faces a decisive moment at the $0.20 level. With low resistance ahead, a breakout could send DOGE soaring if buyers hold their ground.\n\nDogecoin [DOGE] has shown renewed strength recently, but on-chain and derivative data suggest its next move hinges heavily on the $0.20 price level.\n\nWith key metrics offering mixed signals, traders and investors closely watch whether DOGE can convert this level from resistance into a launchpad.\n\nGlassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) shows a significant Dogecoin supply concentration at $0.20, about 7% of the total. This cluster ranks as the third-largest after $0.17 and $0.07.\n\nNotably, inflows at $0.20 started increasing around the 22nd of January, though many wallets likely accumulated earlier and raised their cost basis.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThis positioning creates near-term resistance, as many holders may look to exit at break-even.\n\nHowever, the absence of significant supply between $0.20 and $0.31, the next major cluster, means that a clean break above $0.20 could lead to a sharp rally if volume supports it.\n\nGlassnode’s HODL Waves chart showed that 15% of the Dogecoin supply was last moved between six and twelve months ago, implying that many holders bought ahead of the Nov/Dec 2024 rally and are still holding, indicating a strong conviction.\n\nMore recently, the 3-6 month cohort has grown, suggesting new entrants joined during the January rebound from $0.32 to $0.41.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nWhile this HODLing behavior reflects confidence, it also hints at latent supply. If DOGE revisits those levels, some may sell at break-even, potentially capping upward momentum.\n\nDogecoin’s Futures volume remains well below previous peaks. At press time, Open Interest (OI) sat around $1 billion, far lower than the $3 billion average seen during the 2024 highs.\n\nThe 7-day SMA of Futures volume is gradually rising, but levels are still reminiscent of October 2024. This suggested that leveraged trades are not fueling the ongoing rally.\n\nAlso, this is supported by the Futures Funding Rate chart, which shows that rates have fallen to near-neutral levels. The lack of aggressive long positioning means the price uptrend is being driven more by organic spot demand than speculative leverage.\n\nAt the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.195, up slightly on the day and still above its 50-day Moving Average of $0.182.\n\nThe RSI reading of 63.05 suggested moderate bullish momentum without being overbought. However, the price has paused just shy of the critical $0.20 barrier.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nIf bulls manage to push past this zone with strong volume, the lack of resistance up to $0.31, as seen in URPD data, could allow for rapid price acceleration. However, failure to break above may lead to consolidation or a minor pullback.\n\nDogecoin’s breakout attempt depends on surpassing the $0.20 level, which currently acts as a supply ceiling, while there’s a lack of resistance above it. Spot buyers hold control, and long-term holders remain inactive.\n\nDOGE’s short-term direction will rely on volume dynamics and trader confidence. If the $0.20 resistance flips into support, a successful breakout could push DOGE toward $0.31.\n\n"

This version was then sent back to the Senate for a final vote.\n\nWith Trump’s AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, confirming Trump’s support for repealing the rule, momentum against the regulation has grown.\n\nThe rule aimed to enforce strict reporting requirements on DeFi platforms, mandating exchanges to disclose transaction details and gross proceeds.\n\nApplauding the Senate vote, Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith said in a statement,\n\n“Following its second bipartisan vote in the Senate, the Congressional Review Act resolution to roll back the DeFi-killing broker rule now moves to President Trump’s desk for a final signature.”\n\nShe further added,\n\nThank you to Senator Cruz, Representative Carey, and all of the pro-innovation members who voted to strike down the DeFi broker rule.”\n\nHowever, despite strong bipartisan support for repealing the DeFi broker rule, some lawmakers remained firmly opposed.\n\nCritics argue that such regulations would place excessive burdens on decentralized platforms, stifling innovation and limiting the growth of the DeFi sector.\n\nDemocratic Representative Lloyd Doggett criticized the resolution, claiming it provides special exemptions that benefit wealthy individuals. He argued that it could facilitate tax evasion and illicit financial activities.\n\nDoggett warned that removing the rule might create loopholes for bad actors, including tax cheats and criminal enterprises.\n\nThis coincided with the broader crypto market reflecting mixed sentiment, with the global market cap dipping to $2.86 trillion—a 0.41% decline over the last day.\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin [BTC] was trading at $87,480.97 after a slight 0.16% drop, while Ethereum [ETH] saw a sharper 1.68% decline, trading at $2,027.13.\n\nTherefore, as regulatory battles continue to shape the industry, market participants remain watchful of how these developments could influence the future of decentralized finance.\n\n"

It was still stuck on its Q1 downtrend and had shed 30% from record highs of $3.4.\n\nIn fact, renowned price chart analyst Peter Brandt projected that the altcoin could crash 43% if it slipped below $1.9. He cited the bearish formation of an H&S (head and shoulder) pattern, which, if validated, would target $1.07.\n\n“$XRP is forming a textbook H&S pattern. So, we are now range-bound. Above 3.000, I would not want to be short. Below 1.9, I would not want to own it. H&S projects to 1.07”\n\nSource: X\n\nSome on-chain signals also painted a similar weak outlook. On a weekly average, XRP Ledger active addresses declined by 62% from 74K users at the December peak to 28K in March.\n\nAccording to Santiment’s MVRV Z score, XRP was still relatively overvalued at current levels. The indicator tracks whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued relative to its price.\n\nA reading above one could be deemed ‘overpriced’ as more holders are in profit and could sell.  On the contrary, MVRV Z score values below one are perceived as ‘undervalued.’\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nFor Ripple, the metric climbed above 6 in December and was 2.8 at press time. Simply put, long-term holders had 2.8X-6X unrealized gain and could potentially book profit and tank XRP.\n\nBut the level of accumulation seen in the past seven trading days didn’t support the bearish inclination.\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nPer Coinglass data, $43 million worth of XRP was withdrawn from exchanges this week. Overall, $290 million worth of XRP left exchanges in March, suggesting that some players expected an extra rally. Will their long bet materialize?\n\nSource: XRP/USDT, TradingView\n\nFrom a price chart perspective, the $2 (cyan) and $1.4 (white) levels were key supports to watch before Brandt’s target.\n\nIn addition, the price action was still above the 200 Daily Moving Average (DMA) in blue, which meant that XRP’s bullish market structure was still intact, at least as of this writing.\n\n"

This move indicated that Ethereum could be entering a recovery phase after its prolonged bear market.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,064.80, following a slight 0.10% decrease over the last 24 hours.\n\nHistorically, when Ethereum crosses its realized price, it marks the beginning of a bullish trend. Therefore, this could be a crucial turning point for ETH. However, it still faces several hurdles that could slow down its momentum.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum’s MVRV ratio stood at approximately 1.02. MVRV ratios below 1 historically mean that a market bottom is near, while ratios above 2.4 indicate overvaluation. Ethereum’s press time position, therefore, signaled that while in a recovery phase, the altcoin was not yet overvalued.\n\nOn the charts, Ethereum faces substantial resistance ahead at the $2,300-level. According to the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, this level marks a critical barrier that ETH must clear for a sustained bullish trend. ETH is also trading within a falling wedge channel near the upper boundary. Therefore, the price action around $2,300 will be pivotal in determining whether Ethereum’s recovery continues or stalls.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nWhale activity continues to support the mid-term bullish case for ETH. Notably, BlackRock recently accumulated 1.25 million ETH worth around $2.5 billion – A sign of heightened institutional interest.\n\nHowever, on-chain metrics pointed to some mixed signals. Ethereum’s exchange reserves increased to 18.375 million ETH, up +0.18% in the last 24 hours. Rather than indicating demand, this uptick may suggest growing sell-side pressure as more ETH is being deposited into exchanges – Often a precursor to potential profit-taking.\n\nMeanwhile, user activity has remained strong, with 20,913 active addresses recorded – A +0.99% hike over the same period. This uptick in active wallets hinted at sustained network engagement, a positive sign for ETH’s fundamental health.\n\nOn the contrary, Ethereum’s gas usage dropped sharply to 2.19 billion ETH – A steep decline from recent highs near 22 billion. This could reflect lower transaction volumes or fall in smart contract execution – Potentially signaling a short-term cooldown in network activity.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nAs predicted previously by AMBCrypto, Ethereum now faces a critical resistance zone between $2,200 and $2,250. Breaking above this zone could pave the way for a retest of the $2,400-level.\n\nHowever, if ETH struggles to maintain its momentum, it could face a pullback to the $2,000-support level. Therefore, market participants will need to watch for signs of either a breakthrough or a potential reversal.\n\nEthereum has seen some strong signs of recovery, with positive MVRV ratios and growing institutional interest. However, the $2,300-resistance remains a significant hurdle.\n\nWhile ETH has the potential to break through this level, overcoming it will require sustained buying momentum and the clearing of key barriers. Given the prevailing market conditions, Ethereum is likely to face challenges in breaking this resistance in the short term.\n\n"

In fact, recent data from CryptoQuant indicated a resurgence in XRPL activity since 23 March – Reversing a prior decline observed since 19 March.\n\nOwing to the same, XRP was trading just below $2.40 on the charts, up by just over 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe recent surge in XRP activity came on the back of remarks from Jasmine Cooper, RippleX’s Head of Products. She stressed on XRPL’s efficiency as a key factor attracting institutional investors.\n\nWith its speed and reliability, XRPL is also becoming a preferred choice for asset issuers and institutional players.\n\nOpenEden, for instance, has achieved significant milestones in tokenizing U.S Treasury bills on the platform, offering institutional investors access to on-chain financial instruments. Additionally, BlackRock, a global asset management giant, is actively exploring asset tokenization, further aligning with XRPL’s growing role in the evolving digital finance landscape.\n\nRemarking on the success of XRPL, Cooper, in a podcast with Tony Edward, noted,\n\n“SockGen, for example, that are interested in issuing stable coins on the XRP ledger to asset managers that are participating with some of the tokenization platforms. There’s been, you know, Aberdeen has issued certain money market funds through Archax, which is a tokenization provider on the XRP ledger. So, I think there’s a wide range from banks to asset managers that are starting to discover the value of tokenization and of XRPL in particular.”\n\nThe exec went on to say,\n\n“So, RLUSD is doing well. Adoption has been rapid. You know, there’s support in a variety of different centralized exchanges. Market cap is rapidly growing. So I think we’re excited about it.”\n\nCooper further shed light on XRPL’s expanding ecosystem. She stated that it is setting the stage for broader adoption, driven by advancements in DeFi and cross-border payments. Finally, she noted how the introduction of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) has enhanced on-chain trading and liquidity, reducing reliance on centralized exchanges.\n\nRippleX’s efforts to integrate an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain that aims to attract developers by enabling Ethereum-based smart contracts while leveraging XRPL’s efficiency is also gaining traction.\n\nThat being said, the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s new USD-backed stablecoin, has further strengthened the network’s utility. Particularly in cross-border transactions.\n\nTherefore, if RLUSD secures regulatory approval and gains institutional traction, XRPL’s adoption could accelerate, positioning it as a key player in blockchain finance.\n\n"

However, with improving fundamentals and growing institutional interest, could a 60% rally in Q2 push ETH towards $3,200?\n\nLet’s dive into the key factors that could fuel this move.\n\nEthereum opened Q1 at $3,334, but it has since retraced to $2,053 – Posting a 38% drawdown with only a week remaining in the quarter.\n\nIn comparison, ETH’s 2024 Q1 rally saw it closing at an all-time high of $4,081 – An 84% quarterly gain. This stark divergence raises concerns about Ethereum’s structural weakness, as both liquidity inflows and network activity have remained subdued.\n\nConsequently, the implications extend beyond short-term price action. In fact, analysts have revised year-end targets by nearly 60%, citing weak institutional participation.\n\nCompounding this, the ETH/BTC pair recently fell to a five-year low, diverging from its 2024 yearly high. Unlike previous cycles, Ethereum has failed to attract capital rotation during Bitcoin’s bullish consolidation.\n\nFor instance, while BTC reclaimed $88k following a two-week correction, ETH’s rebound to $2k saw no significant uptick in trading volume – A sign of weakening demand.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nGiven this backdrop, a 60% Q2 rally might be unlikely. And yet, Ethereum has a track record of defying expectations.\n\nCould this be another instance of an unexpected breakout?\n\nIn Q2 2024, Bitcoin closed the quarter 14% below its opening price, while Ethereum demonstrated relative strength with only a 5% decline. This outperformance highlighted ETH’s resilience, despite broader market corrections.\n\nA potential market shock, therefore, would arise if Ethereum replicates this trend in Q2 2025.\n\nWhile the ETH/BTC pair remains suppressed, Open Interest (OI) and Funding Rates (FR) in Ethereum Futures suggest traders may be positioning for an alternative outcome.\n\nNotably, Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) surged to an all-time high – Indicating an influx of high-risk capital.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nHistorically, such elevated leverage has acted as a double-edged sword — Either fueling a breakout or triggering cascading liquidations.\n\nFor Ethereum to capitalize on this leverage buildup, a confluence of factors is required – Sustained Bitcoin strength, increasing spot demand, and a resurgence in institutional inflows.\n\nShould these conditions materialize, the likelihood of an unexpected 60% rally towards $3,200 transitions from speculative optimism to a structurally supported market scenario.\n\n"

Michael Saylor, the pioneer of BTC strategy, termed it a “step in the right direction.” According to reports, the gaming firm has $4.6 billion in cash reserves right now.\n\nIn fact, according to GameStop’s 10-K filing with the SEC, its groundwork for BTC adoption mirrors Strategy’s (MicroStrategy), including through debt and stock issuance.\n\nSource: SEC (excerpt of 10-K filing)\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Treasuries, 88 public companies control a whopping 665,030 BTC as part of their Bitcoin strategy. In fact, they are the second largest category of BTC holders after funds like ETFs, which have over 1.29M BTC.\n\nAlthough some view the FOMO among companies as a net positive for BTC’s value due to growing demand, some had opposite opinions. According to analyst Checkmatey, the growing number of firms jumping on the bandwagon is a likely top signal.\n\n“I made a claim that zombie companies like Gamestop ‘pulling a Saylor’ as a get out of jail card would be a clear topping signal.”\n\nThat being said, most firms that have adopted this strategy have seen massive pumps on their stocks. Strategy’s MSTR, for example, has rallied by over 2000% since adopting BTC in 2020, outperforming the crypto by 3.3x.\n\nSimilarly, Metaplanet’s stock pumped by 2,240% since adopting BTC in April 2024. Will investors in the meme stock GME benefit from a similar windfall trend? Well, that remains to be seen. However, the stock was up 10% slightly after the U.S market opened on Wednesday.\n\nSource: Google Finance\n\n"
