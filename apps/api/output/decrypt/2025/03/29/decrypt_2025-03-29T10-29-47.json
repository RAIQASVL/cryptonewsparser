According to Musk, the merger values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44 billion in April 2022. By October 2024, Fidelity Investments adjusted the valuation of its stake in X, estimating the company’s overall value to be approximately $9.4 billion.\n\nThough its valuation had recovered somewhat by December 2024, it was still down a whopping 77% from Musk’s purchase price. How Musk arrived at a $33 billion valuation, in other words, would make for interesting reading.\n\n@xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt).\n\nSince its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at…\n\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025\n\nAlready the head of several companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, Musk launched xAI in July 2023, a year after purchasing Twitter. While he said the goal of xAI was to “understand reality,” an ongoing feud with former business partner OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was also a driving factor.\n\n“Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution, and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Musk wrote on X Friday. “The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.”\n\nCalling X “the digital town square,” Musk said the platform boasted over 600 million active users. However, Meta, which launched a rival social media platform, Threads, in July 2023, and Bluesky, which launched in February of that year, have been trying to woo away users.\n\nElon Musk's rebellious AI chatbot Grok, which was recently upgraded and made available to X users for free, is living up to its promise of being uncensored—just not in the way its creator likely intended.\nGrok3, which had been characterized by Musk as a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” basically thinks its progenitor is a liar and often yields answers that directly contradict Musk's own statements and political positions, creating a bizarre scenario where the billionaire's own technology appears to...\n\nBluesky's user count surpassed 27.44 million users in January 2025, many of whom had left Twitter after Musk’s takeover. At the same time, bolstered by its connections to Facebook and Instagram, Threads had over 320 million monthly active users as of February 2025.\n\nMusk made headlines in July of last year when it was revealed that Grok would be trained on X user data. The setting can be disabled, but is on by default for user accounts.\n\nSome social media users jeered today’s announcement, mocking the apparently sizable valuation boost in a deal between two of Musk's own companies.\n\n“I also sold my 2008 Honda Accord to myself for $1 million,” New York Times tech reporter Ryan Mac said on Bluesky.\n\n“Wait a min…what’s different though… other than on paper?” an X user asked.\n\nCongratulations to @elonmusk on xAI's acquisition of X.\n\nNot even we could have predicted this! pic.twitter.com/6d0ao7h3ci\n\n— Polymarket (@Polymarket) March 28, 2025\n\nThe merger, however, could serve a more pragmatic purpose. With X still carrying significant debt—$12 billion, according to Musk's tweet—folding it into the xAI umbrella could give the company access to new investors, improved valuation, and a narrative pivot away from Twitter’s chaotic takeover.\n\n“This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress,” he said.\n\n$83,374.00\n\n$1,874.82\n\n$2.10\n\n$606.91\n\n$126.49\n\n$0.99993\n\n$0.172687\n\n$0.677656\n\n$0.234599\n\n$1,874.58\n\n$83,262.00\n\n$3.70\n\n$9.69\n\n$13.86\n\n$20.01\n\n$0.267839\n\n$2,244.50\n\n$1.00\n\n$2.38\n\n$0.00001282\n\n$0.172899\n\n$86.22\n\n$4.12\n\n$6.31\n\n$306.15\n\n$0.828962\n\n$4.66\n\n$1,876.45\n\n$0.999505\n\n$0.997399\n\n$12.68\n\n$1,993.21\n\n$28.53\n\n$216.67\n\n$6.11\n\n$5.41\n\n$0.0000076\n\n$2.65\n\n$1.045\n\n$48.86\n\n$35.96\n\n$22.68\n\n$0.101779\n\n$0.80764\n\n$83,479.00\n\n$177.92\n\n$5.45\n\n$0.999283\n\n$16.90\n\n$0.805098\n\n$1.16\n\n$10.11\n\n$0.02319676\n\n$232.85\n\n$0.373276\n\n$4.45\n\n$1.00\n\n$3.27\n\n$3.62\n\n$2.80\n\n$83,166.00\n\n$0.203716\n\n$4.02\n\n$0.064872\n\n$0.187004\n\n$0.500733\n\n$0.338297\n\n$5.33\n\n$11.12\n\n$0.478003\n\n$83,170.00\n\n$0.796451\n\n$0.488917\n\n$1,401.43\n\n$1,951.07\n\n$0.463798\n\n$1,873.28\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.068896\n\n$131.75\n\n$0.574239\n\n$68.85\n\n$17.34\n\n$0.802314\n\n$0.63669\n\n$0.999013\n\n$2,122.22\n\n$0.997803\n\n$0.00001165\n\n$0.183693\n\n$8.97\n\n$0.998967\n\n$0.091555\n\n$0.862541\n\n$7.85\n\n$0.559087\n\n$0.998641\n\n$0.01312797\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.893355\n\n$82,841.00\n\n$3,110.13\n\n$0.998579\n\n$1,988.62\n\n$606.02\n\n$0.01578121\n\n$0.662504\n\n$0.00000068\n\n$3,100.09\n\n$0.274886\n\n$83,363.00\n\n$2.15\n\n$0.176007\n\n$32.28\n\n$0.480501\n\n$0.999743\n\n$161.92\n\n$0.103488\n\n$0.384411\n\n$1.97\n\n$7.90\n\n$0.00006019\n\n$1,952.41\n\n$35.85\n\n$0.01128311\n\n$3.03\n\n$0.147397\n\n$16.13\n\n$138.60\n\n$0.421575\n\n$0.999617\n\n$0.075941\n\n$1.75\n\n$0.666421\n\n$0.999376\n\n$0.999531\n\n$2.99\n\n$81,367.00\n\n$16.67\n\n$0.999115\n\n$0.00506741\n\n$0.248375\n\n$1.68\n\n$0.425497\n\n$27.99\n\n$6.40\n\n$1,987.34\n\n$0.475139\n\n$0.716174\n\n$0.172473\n\n$0.441629\n\n$6.65\n\n$1,876.20\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$83,258.00\n\n$84,134.00\n\n$2.61\n\n$0.418879\n\n$0.152282\n\n$0.082106\n\n$1,876.47\n\n$0.999329\n\n$1.08\n\n$1,874.79\n\n$0.619264\n\n$0.401924\n\n$0.04205501\n\n$0.00002009\n\n$1.13\n\n$0.48988\n\n$110.49\n\n$0.486743\n\n$1.096\n\n$0.00738803\n\n$0.00603742\n\n$1,956.54\n\n$0.00665929\n\n$83,345.00\n\n$0.203817\n\n$0.862599\n\n$40.20\n\n$0.372763\n\n$0.99915\n\n$0.998979\n\n$0.0040401\n\n$0.999196\n\n$0.00000165\n\n$1,886.76\n\n$82,752.00\n\n$1,871.36\n\n$0.166762\n\n$0.00005984\n\n$0.999808\n\n$1.35\n\n$122.32\n\n$0.03182287\n\n$0.0094442\n\n$0.0314225\n\n$1.26\n\n$0.24911\n\n$0.261209\n\n$1,857.48\n\n$3.81\n\n$0.00049822\n\n$0.539469\n\n$2.66\n\n$0.669373\n\n$1.38\n\n$1,877.30\n\n$2.89\n\n$0.793969\n\n$83,275.00\n\n$82,683.00\n\n$21.95\n\n$0.193816\n\n$2,052.28\n\n$0.09081\n\n$1,980.61\n\n$1.097\n\n$16.15\n\n$0.259853\n\n$3,083.14\n\n$0.06842\n\n$0.03632611\n\n$0.03134473\n\n$2,038.54\n\n$0.106938\n\n$0.484117\n\n$0.00323003\n\n$0.11746\n\n$0.00232241\n\n$0.03101224\n\n$0.523739\n\n$1,870.47\n\n$0.956734\n\n$0.999709\n\n$1,676.92\n\n$0.00491848\n\n$0.666713\n\n$0.01138476\n\n$0.533371\n\n$0.302896\n\n$20.18\n\n$0.0024779\n\n$2.17\n\n$0.999445\n\n$0.0023811\n\n$0.9983\n\nElon Musk's rebellious AI chatbot Grok, which was recently upgraded and made available to X users for free, is living up to its promise of being uncensored—just not in the way its creator likely intended.\nGrok3, which had been characterized by Musk as a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” basically thinks its progenitor is a liar and often yields answers that directly contradict Musk's own statements and political positions, creating a bizarre scenario where the billionaire's own technology appears to...\n\nThe world hasn’t actually turned into an anime, but it sure does feel that way. \nAn accelerating trend of turning images into styles made popular by Japanese animation studio Studio Ghibli has taken over social media, leading to overloaded OpenAI GPUs and growing debate about artificial intelligence’s role in art and creation—plus a new Solana meme coin that’s reached a nearly $30 million market cap. \nWhat exactly is going on?

    "full_content": "# FDIC Clears Path for Bank Crypto Activities Without Prior Approval\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nBanks can engage in cryptocurrency and other legally permitted activities without seeking prior regulatory approval, so long as they manage risks appropriately, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced Friday.\n\nThe policy change rescinds a 2022 requirement that mandated FDIC-supervised institutions notify the agency before engaging in crypto-related activities. Under the new guidance, banks can offer services involving digital assets without the agency's advance permission.\n\n\"With today's action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,\" FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said in a statement. \"I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.\"\n\nThe move aligns with similar actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which earlier this month reaffirmed that national banks can engage in certain crypto activities, including custody services and stablecoin transactions.\n\nThis regulatory shift marks a stark departure from the Biden administration's approach to cryptocurrency and banking relationships. Documents released earlier this year through Freedom of Information Act requests showed the FDIC frequently deterred banks from offering crypto-related services, critics claimed.\n\nThe previous regulatory stance had drawn criticism from lawmakers who started investigations into what some called \"Operation Chokepoint 2.0,\" a reference to an Obama-era initiative that targeted certain industries including firearms dealers and payday lenders. Critics claimed the Biden administration had similarly targeted the cryptocurrency industry through banking restrictions.\n\nIn its new Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025), the FDIC clarified that \"FDIC-supervised institutions may engage in permissible crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval.\"\n\nThe reversal follows months of pressure from cryptocurrency advocates and completes a significant pivot in federal banking policy. Industry representatives had accused regulators of using informal pressure tactics, including concerns about \"reputational risk,\" to discourage banks from serving cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nAmerican Bankers Association President and CEO Rob Nichols praised the decision. \"We welcome FDIC’s new guidance allowing supervised institutions to engage in permissible crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval,” he said in an official statement. “America’s banks are actively evaluating ways to compete safely and responsibly across the financial services ecosystem, and this type of regulatory clarity is critical to enhancing innovation in the space.\"\n\nAmerican banks seeking to offer customers services built on public blockchain networks appear to have been discouraged from doing so by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, documents released Friday revealed. \nThe disclosure came courtesy of a trove of newly unredacted crypto-related correspondences between the FDIC and member banks. San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase obtained the documents via the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. Last month, Coinbase secured heavily...\n\nThe FDIC emphasized that banks still need to consider various risks associated with crypto activities, including market and liquidity risks, operational and cybersecurity concerns, consumer protection requirements, and anti-money laundering obligations. The agency noted that institutions \"should engage with their supervisory team as appropriate\" when pursuing such activities.\n\nFriday's announcement comes as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to remove hurdles for digital assets.

Under the new guidance, banks can offer services involving digital assets without the agency's advance permission.\n\n\"With today's action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,\" FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said in a statement. \"I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.\"\n\nThe move aligns with similar actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which earlier this month reaffirmed that national banks can engage in certain crypto activities, including custody services and stablecoin transactions.\n\nThis regulatory shift marks a stark departure from the Biden administration's approach to cryptocurrency and banking relationships. Documents released earlier this year through Freedom of Information Act requests showed the FDIC frequently deterred banks from offering crypto-related services, critics claimed.\n\nThe previous regulatory stance had drawn criticism from lawmakers who started investigations into what some called \"Operation Chokepoint 2.0,\" a reference to an Obama-era initiative that targeted certain industries including firearms dealers and payday lenders. Critics claimed the Biden administration had similarly targeted the cryptocurrency industry through banking restrictions.\n\nIn its new Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025), the FDIC clarified that \"FDIC-supervised institutions may engage in permissible crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval.\"\n\nThe reversal follows months of pressure from cryptocurrency advocates and completes a significant pivot in federal banking policy. Industry representatives had accused regulators of using informal pressure tactics, including concerns about \"reputational risk,\" to discourage banks from serving cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nAmerican Bankers Association President and CEO Rob Nichols praised the decision. \"We welcome FDIC’s new guidance allowing supervised institutions to engage in permissible crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval,” he said in an official statement. “America’s banks are actively evaluating ways to compete safely and responsibly across the financial services ecosystem, and this type of regulatory clarity is critical to enhancing innovation in the space.\"\n\nAmerican banks seeking to offer customers services built on public blockchain networks appear to have been discouraged from doing so by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, documents released Friday revealed. \nThe disclosure came courtesy of a trove of newly unredacted crypto-related correspondences between the FDIC and member banks. San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase obtained the documents via the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. Last month, Coinbase secured heavily...\n\nThe FDIC emphasized that banks still need to consider various risks associated with crypto activities, including market and liquidity risks, operational and cybersecurity concerns, consumer protection requirements, and anti-money laundering obligations. The agency noted that institutions \"should engage with their supervisory team as appropriate\" when pursuing such activities.\n\nFriday's announcement comes as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to remove hurdles for digital assets. Besides the OCC’s actions, the government is pushing for a crypto reserve, and taking actions to boost the local crypto ecosystem.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency advocates welcomed the policy reversal, challenges remain for the industry—which, as consequence, means not everyone is excited with this regulatory shift. “Holy shit, the next Wall St. crash is going to make us long for the good ol' days of the Great Depression,” said Justin Rosario, host of the political podcast “The Opinionated Ogre.”\n\nOthers expressed concerns about the abruptness of the change. “FDIC announces robust new requirement to engage in crypto activities: you must pinky swear,” bank advisor and expert Donald F.

    "full_content": "# Nintendo Switch 2 Preview: Everything You Need to Know\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nThe Switch is Nintendo’s best-selling home console of all time, and widely beloved for its rich library of games—a dramatic turn from the middling Wii U before it. But it’s been eight years since the Switch launched, and fans are getting antsy for Nintendo’s next big thing.\n\nLuckily, it's coming. Following years of leaks and rumors, and even a couple official acknowledgments that the next-gen model was coming, Nintendo formally revealed the Switch 2 console in January 2025.\n\nFrom what we know officially and what's been widely reported, the Switch successor will pack in more power than the original while maintaining its winning blend of home console and handheld functionality. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nIt's official: Nintendo is making a successor to its wildly popular Switch console. Granted, that's no surprise to anyone that's followed the video game industry for more than a minute. But now we've seen what's coming.\n\nNintendo shared the first official teaser video below on January 16, 2025, sharing many key details for the Switch 2 while still playing coy on others. We've learned a lot from this video, no doubt, but there's still plenty we want to know.\n\nBut this isn't the first time that Nintendo has officially commented. On May 7, 2024, Nintendo's official corporate account tweeted the following statement:\n\n\"This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.\"\n\nThis is Furukawa, President of Nintendo.

We will be holding a Nintendo Direct…\n\n— 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) May 7, 2024\n\nEven ahead of the May 2024 announcement, Nintendo was clearly planning for what’s next. In response to a fan question in June 2023, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said, “As for the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next-generation machine, we want to do as much as possible in order to smoothly transition our customers, while utilizing the Nintendo Account.”\n\nReports had long pointed to a late 2024 release target, but that didn't happen. Now, with the official trailer launch, all we have is a \"2025\" release window.\n\nWe can make some educated guesses here, however. Nintendo will hold a Direct livestream on April 2, 2025 at 9am ET to presumably share much more about the console, and then hold hands-on events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas throughout the rest of the month, with the last announced event ending on April 27.\n\nGo hands-on with #NintendoSwitch2 at Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas!\n\nA free Nintendo Account is required to register.\n\nFind out more: https://t.co/EECzR6hCk3 pic.twitter.com/Ky1NUaiDah\n\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) January 16, 2025\n\nNothing is official, but a June release target has been widely reported, including in a late March report from Insider Gaming citing retailer launch documents. Pre-orders are expected to begin either April 2, following the stream, or a week later on April 9.\n\nAny in-demand console launch is inevitably plagued by shortages, but Nintendo's president says the company is already thinking ahead to how to minimize the impact the next time around.\n\nIn an investor-centric Q&A from June 2024 translated from Japanese by IGN, Shuntaro Furukawa said that Nintendo is thinking ahead to supply issues and looking into how local laws and regulations could help stymie the resale market that many consoles get snapped up and sold into at inflated prices. Furthermore, the firm doesn't anticipate significant component shortages that could slow console manufacturing.\n\n“Although we were unable to produce sufficient quantities of Nintendo Switch hardware last year and the year before due to a shortage of semiconductor components, this situation has now been resolved,\" he said. \"At this time, we do not believe that the shortage of components will have a significant impact on the production of the successor model.\"\n\nIn February 2025, during the firm's latest earnings call, Furukawa reiterated that the company is aiming to discourage scalpers from buying up available stock for the resale market.\n\n“We will take all possible measures based on the experience we have accumulated to date (regarding scalpers and the like). We are making preparations,\" he said, per Nikkei (via VGC).\n\nEven with Nintendo's preparations, however, there's concern that launch supplies won't meet demand. The unnamed \"large U.S. retailer\" that provided documents to Insider Gaming is expecting a day-one pre-order sellout, for example.\n\nOfficially, we don't know yet: Nintendo hasn't said anything on this front. But there's been plenty of speculation.\n\nThe original Switch launched for $300 in 2017, with the purely handheld Switch Lite rolling out for $200 in 2019. With some premium enhancements (including a larger, bolder screen), the Nintendo Switch OLED model shipped for $350 in 2021.\n\nIn October 2023, a leaker—who WCCF Tech said has previously shared reliable information—claimed that the price point for the Switch 2 will be $449 for the base model and $400 for a version that is fully digital without cartridge support. The official Switch 2 trailer did not showcase or point to any fully digital model, however, so that may not actually be in the works.\n\nThe Switch 2 will launch into an increasingly competitive handheld landscape that includes many PC gaming devices. Valve's popular Steam Deck, for example, starts at $399 for the base model with an LCD screen, while more robust models with OLED panels start at $549.\n\nAfter a whole ton of speculation, much of which was right on-target, we can finally say: The Switch 2 looks like a bigger Switch, mostly.\n\nNintendo thankfully isn't ditching the Switch's smash-success hybrid design, delivering a handheld that can easily be docked for TV use. At its core, the Switch 2 doesn't change too much. But there are some notable tweaks and upgrades we're seeing from the trailer and official imagery so far.\n\nFirst off, the screen and Joy-Con attachment controllers are definitely larger. If we had to guess on screen size, we'd estimate somewhere around 7-8 inches, compared to 6.2 inches on the normal Switch. But Nintendo has yet to release official specs.\n\nThe model shown in the first trailer ditches the bold red and blue Joy-Con designs of the original launch model, instead going for a sleek black or perhaps dark gray scheme with red and blue accents under the analog sticks and in the connective tissue between the console (screen) unit and controllers.\n\nInstead of having these Joy-Con controllers slide into place, they'll plug in via an adapter port and be held in place with what appear to be magnets. There had been significant speculation that the Switch 2 will use electromagnets to keep the controllers in place. We can also see from the trailer that there's a new release button on the back of each Joy-Con that triggers a small plunger to disconnect them from the unit.\n\nFurthermore, there appears to be a new sensor on the Switch 2 Joy-cons that lets them be used like a computer mouse on a flat surface, once plugged into the wrist strap attachments. This appears to confirm speculation regarding mouse-like functionality, enabling more advanced control schemes for games like shooters, strategy sims, and maybe even creative apps.\n\nNintendo even has the Joy-Cons scurrying around like little techie mice in the trailer. But the right Joy-Con appears to ditch the infrared camera found on the original model, which was barely used by many games anyway.\n\nOther interesting details from the trailer: The new kickstand is much larger and hopefully sturdier than that of the original Switch, allowing for more freestanding positions. Also, there are now two USB-C ports—one on top and one on the bottom. Is the extra one meant to enable potentially new accessories?\n\nIn an updated render shared by Nintendo in late March, the small button at the bottom of the face of the right Joy-con controller now has a \"C\" emblazoned on it. Will it be a \"Cast\" button for streaming, or is it something else entirely? We should find out next week.\n\nAnd we know that the Switch 2 will continue to use the same physical cartridges from the Switch—yes, enabling backwards compatability—along with downloadable games.\n\nNintendo hasn't shared official specs yet, and the one game from the trailer didn't give a great sense of a visual upgrade. But we certainly expect a notable step up from what the original Switch could handle.\n\nReports suggest that Nintendo will not try to compete with the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X as the standard-bearers for home consoles and instead deliver a gaming experience with a bit less fidelity. That's been the standard Nintendo approach for a few generations now. Even so, it sounds like a significant improvement over the Switch.\n\nIn September 2023, leaked documents from major game publisher Activision showed that the company had evaluated the hardware in late 2022, ultimately surmising that the Switch successor will have similar power to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hardware.\n\nWhile those are 10-year-old home consoles, it still would be a notable step up from what the original Switch can handle. The Switch’s hybrid home-plus-handheld model also means that Nintendo has to keep in mind a slim form factor and battery life expectations, so it’s unlikely that we’d even see a Switch-like device with top-end internals at a reasonable price.\n\nEurogamer reported that Nintendo showed off private tech demos for the Switch 2 to developers at the Gamescom conference in August 2023, and that it used an upgraded version of 2017’s hit The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a demonstration of the new hardware’s capabilities.\n\nVGC supported that report and added that Nintendo also used Epic Games’ The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5, with capabilities like ray tracing (realistic lighting effects) and AI-driven visual upscaling tricks enabled. Another rumor points to the use of \"ray reconstruction,\" a less hardware-intensive way of delivering ray tracing effects with the help of AI, via Nvidia's DLSS 3.5 tech.\n\nAll told, this may point to hardware that is actually more capable than the PS4 or Xbox One, even if it doesn’t quite match the benchmarks of the current-gen PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It could be relatively well equipped in terms of RAM, however, with noted leaker Felipe Lima suggesting that the device with have 12GB onboard—that's more than the Xbox Series S console at 10GB.\n\nA February 2024 report from Reuters cites a source claiming that the Switch 2 will use a custom Nvidia chip, much like the original Switch hardware did.\n\nAccording to a January 2024 report from Bloomberg, Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase says that Nintendo has picked a sizable 8-inch display for the Switch 2, and the display will use LCD tech as other reports have previously noted. Nintendo declined comment. The current Switch OLED model has a 7-inch screen, so this would be larger than any original Switch device.\n\nMobapad also points to an 8-inch display, which it says it be upgraded from 720p HD resolution on the original Switch to 1080p Full HD resolution on the successor.\n\nWe know one for sure: a new Mario Kart, revealed in the Switch 2 trailer. We don't have an official name yet; Mario Kart 9 would make sense based on the series' mainline entries, though earlier rumors pointed to a name of Mario Kart X to account for the mobile game Mario Kart Tour launching since Mario Kart 8 on Wii U (and later Switch).\n\nWhatever the final name, the new Mario Kart looks much like what we've come to expect from the series, though the brief tease appears to show 24 starting spots on the track—so there may be way more racers than usual.\n\nYou can bet that we’ll see Nintendo’s tried-and-true franchises like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and many others in the mix before long, though Nintendo hasn't shown anything else besides Mario Kart just yet. Previous rumors have pointed to games like a new Donkey Kong or Ubisoft's next as-yet-unannounced Far Cry sequel, but those remain unconfirmed for now.\n\nThe long-delayed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still set to launch on the original Switch in 2025, Nintendo confirmed in February—but it's been widely rumored to also launch on Switch 2.\n\nIn fact, many gamers have suspected that the game's trailer is actually showing Switch 2 footage, but that hasn't been confirmed. But really, why wouldn't Nintendo release it across both consoles? There's precedent too: Nintendo launched The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the same date across Switch and Wii U, and Zelda: Twilight Princess just weeks apart across Wii and GameCube.\n\nElectronic Arts appears to be onboard with the Switch 2, and while that might sound obvious, EA hasn't put a new Madden NFL game on a Nintendo console since 2012. It's true: Madden never hit the Switch, and the company has been pretty selective with Nintendo games in the past.\n\n\"Any time a new console comes into the marketplace, that's of a benefit to us,\" EA CEO Andrew Wilson said during an earnings call in February 2025, per GameSpot. \"It gives us the ability to access and acquire new players. Typically, we've had franchises perform very well on Nintendo platforms. Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also planning to support the Switch 2 with Xbox games, as part of the firm's recent expansion to bring its owned franchises to other hardware. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January 2025 that he's \"really looking forward to supporting\" Nintendo's next console with games.\n\nAfter Rockstar Games' official reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is currently announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, it begs the question: Will it come to Switch 2, too? And perhaps more pressingly, will the Switch 2 be powerful enough to run it?\n\nThere's no official word for now, of course, and there wouldn't be until Nintendo actually reveals its next console. But in the meantime, the technical experts at Digital Foundry are dubious that the Switch 2 will have enough power to handle Rockstar's next big game—at least based on the leaks so far.\n\n\"I’d love to say it would happen. I don’t think it will, realistically,\" said Digital Foundry founder Richard Leadbetter in a YouTube video (via IGN). \"It’s a mobile chipset. We’ve seen a lot of amazing things on the Switch 1. Switch 2 is going to be a lot better, a proper generational leap, and forward-looking in many ways. But the stuff they seem to be rolling out for GTA 6 is possibly beyond that.\"\n\n\"It seems a step beyond,\" he added, \"and out of character with what we know about Rockstar’s M.O.\"\n\nYes! Nintendo tweeted on November 5, 2024 that the \"successor to the Nintendo Switch\" will also be able to play original Switch software. This had been rumored and reported previously, but the gaming giant cleared up any questions about Switch owners making a graceful transition to the new device. The Switch Online service will also return on Switch 2.\n\nThis is Furukawa. At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about…\n\n— 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) November 6, 2024\n\nNintendo repeated the message in the January 2025 trailer, showing that Switch cartridges will fit into the Switch 2, and noting that digital games will also be supported. A physical copy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was shown in the trailer. However, there was a caveat: Some games may not be supported or work in full.\n\nWhat does that mean? While we don't know for sure yet, it's likely that some games designed for the size and shape of the original Joy-Cons—like fitness game Ring Fit Adventure, which had players snap their controllers into an accessory shell—simply won't work with the Switch 2 controllers. And the rare few games that used the IR camera on the original right Joy-Con, like 1-2 Switch, similarly will lose functionality on Switch 2 hardware.\n\nThe other lingering question about backwards compatibility is whether the Switch games will simply run as-is, or if they will take advantage of the Switch 2's expected performance bump—whether that's an automatic upgrade, or one that developers may need to code and patch in.\n\nA report from Eurogamer in February 2024 suggested that Nintendo will let users play their original Switch games (both physical and digital) in the Switch 2 hardware with enhancements. Developers will reportedly need to update their games to unlock such upgrades, however, which means not every game will necessarily take advantage of the Switch 2's improved power.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on September 19, 2023 and last updated on March 28, 2025.\n\n$83,374.00\n\n$1,874.82\n\n$2.10\n\n$606.91\n\n$126.49\n\n$0.99993\n\n$0.172687\n\n$0.677656\n\n$0.234599\n\n$1,874.58\n\n$83,262.00\n\n$3.70\n\n$9.69\n\n$13.86\n\n$20.01\n\n$0.267839\n\n$2,244.50\n\n$1.00\n\n$2.38\n\n$0.00001282\n\n$0.172899\n\n$86.22\n\n$4.12\n\n$6.31\n\n$306.15\n\n$0.828962\n\n$4.66\n\n$1,876.45\n\n$0.999505\n\n$0.997399\n\n$12.68\n\n$1,993.21\n\n$28.53\n\n$216.67\n\n$6.11\n\n$5.41\n\n$0.0000076\n\n$2.65\n\n$1.045\n\n$48.86\n\n$35.96\n\n$22.68\n\n$0.101779\n\n$0.80764\n\n$83,479.00\n\n$177.92\n\n$5.45\n\n$0.999283\n\n$16.90\n\n$0.805098\n\n$1.16\n\n$10.11\n\n$0.02319676\n\n$232.85\n\n$0.373276\n\n$4.45\n\n$1.00\n\n$3.27\n\n$3.62\n\n$2.80\n\n$83,166.00\n\n$0.203716\n\n$4.02\n\n$0.064872\n\n$0.187004\n\n$0.500733\n\n$0.338297\n\n$5.33\n\n$11.12\n\n$0.478003\n\n$83,170.00\n\n$0.796451\n\n$0.488917\n\n$1,401.43\n\n$1,951.07\n\n$0.463798\n\n$1,873.28\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.068896\n\n$131.75\n\n$0.574239\n\n$68.85\n\n$17.34\n\n$0.802314\n\n$0.63669\n\n$0.999013\n\n$2,122.22\n\n$0.997803\n\n$0.00001165\n\n$0.183693\n\n$8.97\n\n$0.998967\n\n$0.091555\n\n$0.862541\n\n$7.85\n\n$0.559087\n\n$0.998641\n\n$0.01312797\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.893355\n\n$82,841.00\n\n$3,110.13\n\n$0.998579\n\n$1,988.62\n\n$606.02\n\n$0.01578121\n\n$0.662504\n\n$0.00000068\n\n$3,100.09\n\n$0.274886\n\n$83,363.00\n\n$2.15\n\n$0.176007\n\n$32.28\n\n$0.480501\n\n$0.999743\n\n$161.92\n\n$0.103488\n\n$0.384411\n\n$1.97\n\n$7.90\n\n$0.00006019\n\n$1,952.41\n\n$35.85\n\n$0.01128311\n\n$3.03\n\n$0.147397\n\n$16.13\n\n$138.60\n\n$0.421575\n\n$0.999617\n\n$0.075941\n\n$1.75\n\n$0.666421\n\n$0.999376\n\n$0.999531\n\n$2.99\n\n$81,367.00\n\n$16.67\n\n$0.999115\n\n$0.00506741\n\n$0.248375\n\n$1.68\n\n$0.425497\n\n$27.99\n\n$6.40\n\n$1,987.34\n\n$0.475139\n\n$0.716174\n\n$0.172473\n\n$0.441629\n\n$6.65\n\n$1,876.20\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$83,258.00\n\n$84,134.00\n\n$2.61\n\n$0.418879\n\n$0.152282\n\n$0.082106\n\n$1,876.47\n\n$0.999329\n\n$1.08\n\n$1,874.79\n\n$0.619264\n\n$0.401924\n\n$0.04205501\n\n$0.00002009\n\n$1.13\n\n$0.48988\n\n$110.49\n\n$0.486743\n\n$1.096\n\n$0.00738803\n\n$0.00603742\n\n$1,956.54\n\n$0.00665929\n\n$83,345.00\n\n$0.203817\n\n$0.862599\n\n$40.20\n\n$0.372763\n\n$0.99915\n\n$0.998979\n\n$0.0040401\n\n$0.999196\n\n$0.00000165\n\n$1,886.76\n\n$82,752.00\n\n$1,871.36\n\n$0.166762\n\n$0.00005984\n\n$0.999808\n\n$1.35\n\n$122.32\n\n$0.03182287\n\n$0.0094442\n\n$0.0314225\n\n$1.26\n\n$0.24911\n\n$0.261209\n\n$1,857.48\n\n$3.81\n\n$0.00049822\n\n$0.539469\n\n$2.66\n\n$0.669373\n\n$1.38\n\n$1,877.30\n\n$2.89\n\n$0.793969\n\n$83,275.00\n\n$82,683.00\n\n$21.95\n\n$0.193816\n\n$2,052.28\n\n$0.09081\n\n$1,980.61\n\n$1.097\n\n$16.15\n\n$0.259853\n\n$3,083.14\n\n$0.06842\n\n$0.03632611\n\n$0.03134473\n\n$2,038.54\n\n$0.106938\n\n$0.484117\n\n$0.00323003\n\n$0.11746\n\n$0.00232241\n\n$0.03101224\n\n$0.523739\n\n$1,870.47\n\n$0.956734\n\n$0.999709\n\n$1,676.92\n\n$0.00491848\n\n$0.666713\n\n$0.01138476\n\n$0.533371\n\n$0.302896\n\n$20.18\n\n$0.0024779\n\n$2.17\n\n$0.999445\n\n$0.0023811\n\n$0.9983\n\nReading\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Preview: Everything You Need to Know\n\nThe Switch is Nintendo’s best-selling home console of all time, and widely beloved for its rich library of games—a dramatic turn from the middling Wii U before it. But it’s been eight years since the Switch launched, and fans are getting antsy for Nintendo’s next big thing.\n\nLuckily, it's coming. Following years of leaks and rumors, and even a couple official acknowledgments that the next-gen model was coming, Nintendo formally revealed the Switch 2 console in January 2025.\n\nFrom what we know officially and what's been widely reported, the Switch successor will pack in more power than the original while maintaining its winning blend of home console and handheld functionality. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nIt's official: Nintendo is making a successor to its wildly popular Switch console. Granted, that's no surprise to anyone that's followed the video game industry for more than a minute. But now we've seen what's coming.\n\nNintendo shared the first official teaser video below on January 16, 2025, sharing many key details for the Switch 2 while still playing coy on others. We've learned a lot from this video, no doubt, but there's still plenty we want to know.\n\nBut this isn't the first time that Nintendo has officially commented. On May 7, 2024, Nintendo's official corporate account tweeted the following statement:\n\n\"This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015.

Now, with the official trailer launch, all we have is a \"2025\" release window.\n\nWe can make some educated guesses here, however. Nintendo will hold a Direct livestream on April 2, 2025 at 9am ET to presumably share much more about the console, and then hold hands-on events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas throughout the rest of the month, with the last announced event ending on April 27.\n\nGo hands-on with #NintendoSwitch2 at Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas!\n\nA free Nintendo Account is required to register.\n\nFind out more: https://t.co/EECzR6hCk3 pic.twitter.com/Ky1NUaiDah\n\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) January 16, 2025\n\nNothing is official, but a June release target has been widely reported, including in a late March report from Insider Gaming citing retailer launch documents. Pre-orders are expected to begin either April 2, following the stream, or a week later on April 9.\n\nAny in-demand console launch is inevitably plagued by shortages, but Nintendo's president says the company is already thinking ahead to how to minimize the impact the next time around.\n\nIn an investor-centric Q&A from June 2024 translated from Japanese by IGN, Shuntaro Furukawa said that Nintendo is thinking ahead to supply issues and looking into how local laws and regulations could help stymie the resale market that many consoles get snapped up and sold into at inflated prices. Furthermore, the firm doesn't anticipate significant component shortages that could slow console manufacturing.\n\n“Although we were unable to produce sufficient quantities of Nintendo Switch hardware last year and the year before due to a shortage of semiconductor components, this situation has now been resolved,\" he said. \"At this time, we do not believe that the shortage of components will have a significant impact on the production of the successor model.\"\n\nIn February 2025, during the firm's latest earnings call, Furukawa reiterated that the company is aiming to discourage scalpers from buying up available stock for the resale market.\n\n“We will take all possible measures based on the experience we have accumulated to date (regarding scalpers and the like). We are making preparations,\" he said, per Nikkei (via VGC).\n\nEven with Nintendo's preparations, however, there's concern that launch supplies won't meet demand. The unnamed \"large U.S. retailer\" that provided documents to Insider Gaming is expecting a day-one pre-order sellout, for example.\n\nOfficially, we don't know yet: Nintendo hasn't said anything on this front. But there's been plenty of speculation.\n\nThe original Switch launched for $300 in 2017, with the purely handheld Switch Lite rolling out for $200 in 2019. With some premium enhancements (including a larger, bolder screen), the Nintendo Switch OLED model shipped for $350 in 2021.\n\nIn October 2023, a leaker—who WCCF Tech said has previously shared reliable information—claimed that the price point for the Switch 2 will be $449 for the base model and $400 for a version that is fully digital without cartridge support. The official Switch 2 trailer did not showcase or point to any fully digital model, however, so that may not actually be in the works.\n\nThe Switch 2 will launch into an increasingly competitive handheld landscape that includes many PC gaming devices. Valve's popular Steam Deck, for example, starts at $399 for the base model with an LCD screen, while more robust models with OLED panels start at $549.\n\nAfter a whole ton of speculation, much of which was right on-target, we can finally say: The Switch 2 looks like a bigger Switch, mostly.\n\nNintendo thankfully isn't ditching the Switch's smash-success hybrid design, delivering a handheld that can easily be docked for TV use. At its core, the Switch 2 doesn't change too much. But there are some notable tweaks and upgrades we're seeing from the trailer and official imagery so far.\n\nFirst off, the screen and Joy-Con attachment controllers are definitely larger. If we had to guess on screen size, we'd estimate somewhere around 7-8 inches, compared to 6.2 inches on the normal Switch. But Nintendo has yet to release official specs.\n\nThe model shown in the first trailer ditches the bold red and blue Joy-Con designs of the original launch model, instead going for a sleek black or perhaps dark gray scheme with red and blue accents under the analog sticks and in the connective tissue between the console (screen) unit and controllers.\n\nInstead of having these Joy-Con controllers slide into place, they'll plug in via an adapter port and be held in place with what appear to be magnets. There had been significant speculation that the Switch 2 will use electromagnets to keep the controllers in place. We can also see from the trailer that there's a new release button on the back of each Joy-Con that triggers a small plunger to disconnect them from the unit.\n\nFurthermore, there appears to be a new sensor on the Switch 2 Joy-cons that lets them be used like a computer mouse on a flat surface, once plugged into the wrist strap attachments. This appears to confirm speculation regarding mouse-like functionality, enabling more advanced control schemes for games like shooters, strategy sims, and maybe even creative apps.\n\nNintendo even has the Joy-Cons scurrying around like little techie mice in the trailer. But the right Joy-Con appears to ditch the infrared camera found on the original model, which was barely used by many games anyway.\n\nOther interesting details from the trailer: The new kickstand is much larger and hopefully sturdier than that of the original Switch, allowing for more freestanding positions. Also, there are now two USB-C ports—one on top and one on the bottom. Is the extra one meant to enable potentially new accessories?\n\nIn an updated render shared by Nintendo in late March, the small button at the bottom of the face of the right Joy-con controller now has a \"C\" emblazoned on it. Will it be a \"Cast\" button for streaming, or is it something else entirely? We should find out next week.\n\nAnd we know that the Switch 2 will continue to use the same physical cartridges from the Switch—yes, enabling backwards compatability—along with downloadable games.\n\nNintendo hasn't shared official specs yet, and the one game from the trailer didn't give a great sense of a visual upgrade. But we certainly expect a notable step up from what the original Switch could handle.\n\nReports suggest that Nintendo will not try to compete with the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X as the standard-bearers for home consoles and instead deliver a gaming experience with a bit less fidelity. That's been the standard Nintendo approach for a few generations now. Even so, it sounds like a significant improvement over the Switch.\n\nIn September 2023, leaked documents from major game publisher Activision showed that the company had evaluated the hardware in late 2022, ultimately surmising that the Switch successor will have similar power to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hardware.\n\nWhile those are 10-year-old home consoles, it still would be a notable step up from what the original Switch can handle. The Switch’s hybrid home-plus-handheld model also means that Nintendo has to keep in mind a slim form factor and battery life expectations, so it’s unlikely that we’d even see a Switch-like device with top-end internals at a reasonable price.\n\nEurogamer reported that Nintendo showed off private tech demos for the Switch 2 to developers at the Gamescom conference in August 2023, and that it used an upgraded version of 2017’s hit The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a demonstration of the new hardware’s capabilities.\n\nVGC supported that report and added that Nintendo also used Epic Games’ The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5, with capabilities like ray tracing (realistic lighting effects) and AI-driven visual upscaling tricks enabled. Another rumor points to the use of \"ray reconstruction,\" a less hardware-intensive way of delivering ray tracing effects with the help of AI, via Nvidia's DLSS 3.5 tech.\n\nAll told, this may point to hardware that is actually more capable than the PS4 or Xbox One, even if it doesn’t quite match the benchmarks of the current-gen PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It could be relatively well equipped in terms of RAM, however, with noted leaker Felipe Lima suggesting that the device with have 12GB onboard—that's more than the Xbox Series S console at 10GB.\n\nA February 2024 report from Reuters cites a source claiming that the Switch 2 will use a custom Nvidia chip, much like the original Switch hardware did.\n\nAccording to a January 2024 report from Bloomberg, Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase says that Nintendo has picked a sizable 8-inch display for the Switch 2, and the display will use LCD tech as other reports have previously noted. Nintendo declined comment. The current Switch OLED model has a 7-inch screen, so this would be larger than any original Switch device.\n\nMobapad also points to an 8-inch display, which it says it be upgraded from 720p HD resolution on the original Switch to 1080p Full HD resolution on the successor.\n\nWe know one for sure: a new Mario Kart, revealed in the Switch 2 trailer. We don't have an official name yet; Mario Kart 9 would make sense based on the series' mainline entries, though earlier rumors pointed to a name of Mario Kart X to account for the mobile game Mario Kart Tour launching since Mario Kart 8 on Wii U (and later Switch).\n\nWhatever the final name, the new Mario Kart looks much like what we've come to expect from the series, though the brief tease appears to show 24 starting spots on the track—so there may be way more racers than usual.\n\nYou can bet that we’ll see Nintendo’s tried-and-true franchises like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and many others in the mix before long, though Nintendo hasn't shown anything else besides Mario Kart just yet. Previous rumors have pointed to games like a new Donkey Kong or Ubisoft's next as-yet-unannounced Far Cry sequel, but those remain unconfirmed for now.\n\nThe long-delayed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still set to launch on the original Switch in 2025, Nintendo confirmed in February—but it's been widely rumored to also launch on Switch 2.\n\nIn fact, many gamers have suspected that the game's trailer is actually showing Switch 2 footage, but that hasn't been confirmed. But really, why wouldn't Nintendo release it across both consoles? There's precedent too: Nintendo launched The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the same date across Switch and Wii U, and Zelda: Twilight Princess just weeks apart across Wii and GameCube.\n\nElectronic Arts appears to be onboard with the Switch 2, and while that might sound obvious, EA hasn't put a new Madden NFL game on a Nintendo console since 2012. It's true: Madden never hit the Switch, and the company has been pretty selective with Nintendo games in the past.\n\n\"Any time a new console comes into the marketplace, that's of a benefit to us,\" EA CEO Andrew Wilson said during an earnings call in February 2025, per GameSpot. \"It gives us the ability to access and acquire new players. Typically, we've had franchises perform very well on Nintendo platforms. Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also planning to support the Switch 2 with Xbox games, as part of the firm's recent expansion to bring its owned franchises to other hardware. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January 2025 that he's \"really looking forward to supporting\" Nintendo's next console with games.\n\nAfter Rockstar Games' official reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is currently announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, it begs the question: Will it come to Switch 2, too? And perhaps more pressingly, will the Switch 2 be powerful enough to run it?\n\nThere's no official word for now, of course, and there wouldn't be until Nintendo actually reveals its next console. But in the meantime, the technical experts at Digital Foundry are dubious that the Switch 2 will have enough power to handle Rockstar's next big game—at least based on the leaks so far.\n\n\"I’d love to say it would happen. I don’t think it will, realistically,\" said Digital Foundry founder Richard Leadbetter in a YouTube video (via IGN). \"It’s a mobile chipset. We’ve seen a lot of amazing things on the Switch 1. Switch 2 is going to be a lot better, a proper generational leap, and forward-looking in many ways. But the stuff they seem to be rolling out for GTA 6 is possibly beyond that.\"\n\n\"It seems a step beyond,\" he added, \"and out of character with what we know about Rockstar’s M.O.\"\n\nYes! Nintendo tweeted on November 5, 2024 that the \"successor to the Nintendo Switch\" will also be able to play original Switch software. This had been rumored and reported previously, but the gaming giant cleared up any questions about Switch owners making a graceful transition to the new device. The Switch Online service will also return on Switch 2.\n\nThis is Furukawa. At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about…\n\n— 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) November 6, 2024\n\nNintendo repeated the message in the January 2025 trailer, showing that Switch cartridges will fit into the Switch 2, and noting that digital games will also be supported. A physical copy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was shown in the trailer. However, there was a caveat: Some games may not be supported or work in full.\n\nWhat does that mean? While we don't know for sure yet, it's likely that some games designed for the size and shape of the original Joy-Cons—like fitness game Ring Fit Adventure, which had players snap their controllers into an accessory shell—simply won't work with the Switch 2 controllers. And the rare few games that used the IR camera on the original right Joy-Con, like 1-2 Switch, similarly will lose functionality on Switch 2 hardware.\n\nThe other lingering question about backwards compatibility is whether the Switch games will simply run as-is, or if they will take advantage of the Switch 2's expected performance bump—whether that's an automatic upgrade, or one that developers may need to code and patch in.\n\nA report from Eurogamer in February 2024 suggested that Nintendo will let users play their original Switch games (both physical and digital) in the Switch 2 hardware with enhancements. Developers will reportedly need to update their games to unlock such upgrades, however, which means not every game will necessarily take advantage of the Switch 2's improved power.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on September 19, 2023 and last updated on March 28, 2025.\n\nTags: #NintendoSwitch2, confirmed in February\n",

The regulator called for both companies to stop allowing New Jersey residents to place bets on athletics events and void existing sports-related wagers from people living there.\n\nRobinhood and Kalshi must comply with the order by the end of March 28 or face enforcement actions, according to the letter.\n\nKalshi has relaunched its betting pools based on U.S. election outcomes—the latest development in a convoluted legal drama that wreaked havoc on the prediction market operator's business strategy last month.\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday lifted a weeks-long freeze on Kalshi's U.S. elections-based prediction markets.\nKalshi briefly launched prediction markets based on the U.S. elections on September 12. However, the firm shuttered those markets shortly after that on the orders of a higher...\n\n“This letter shall serve as official notice that Robinhood [and Kalshi], by facilitating and/or accepting unauthorized sports wagering from individuals within the State of New Jersey, is engaging in activity that is unlawful under not only New Jersey law, but New Jersey’s Constitution,” NJGDE Interim Director Mary Jo Flaherty said in the letter.\n\nThe state regulator added that the trading platforms’ actions violate the New Jersey Sports Wagering Act, which “only permits licensed entities to offer sports wagering to patrons located in New Jersey.”\n\nNearly two weeks ago, Robinhood launched its March Madness prediction markets powered by Kalshi to capitalize on traders’ growing appetites for sports betting. Legal sports wagers exceeded $140 billion in 2024, up roughly 23% from the year prior, CBS Sports reported.\n\nHowever, prediction market operators such as Kalshi have encountered several regulatory obstacles as they aim to address that growing market.\n\nEarlier this month, Kalshi received orders from regulators in Nevada to stop offering derivatives trading on professional and college athletics events in the state. And this week, Barrons reported Washington state regulators are considering issuing Kalshi a similar directive.\n\n\"Event contracts offered by Robinhood Derivatives are federally regulated by the CFTC and offered through CFTC-registered entities, assuring that retail customers can access these prediction markets in a safe and regulated manner,\" Robinhood said through a spokesperson. \"While we do not believe these contracts run afoul of any state laws, we are no longer allowing New Jersey residents to enter new positions for the Men’s and Women’s Basketball Tournament event contacts.”\n\nA Kalshi spokesperson told Decrypt that the company might comment later.\n\nEdited by James Rubin\n\n$83,374.00\n\n$1,874.82\n\n$2.10\n\n$606.91\n\n$126.49\n\n$0.99993\n\n$0.172687\n\n$0.677656\n\n$0.234599\n\n$1,874.58\n\n$83,262.00\n\n$3.70\n\n$9.69\n\n$13.86\n\n$20.01\n\n$0.267839\n\n$2,244.50\n\n$1.00\n\n$2.38\n\n$0.00001282\n\n$0.172899\n\n$86.22\n\n$4.12\n\n$6.31\n\n$306.15\n\n$0.828962\n\n$4.66\n\n$1,876.45\n\n$0.999505\n\n$0.997399\n\n$12.68\n\n$1,993.21\n\n$28.53\n\n$216.67\n\n$6.11\n\n$5.41\n\n$0.0000076\n\n$2.65\n\n$1.045\n\n$48.86\n\n$35.96\n\n$22.68\n\n$0.101779\n\n$0.80764\n\n$83,479.00\n\n$177.92\n\n$5.45\n\n$0.999283\n\n$16.90\n\n$0.805098\n\n$1.16\n\n$10.11\n\n$0.02319676\n\n$232.85\n\n$0.373276\n\n$4.45\n\n$1.00\n\n$3.27\n\n$3.62\n\n$2.80\n\n$83,166.00\n\n$0.203716\n\n$4.02\n\n$0.064872\n\n$0.187004\n\n$0.500733\n\n$0.338297\n\n$5.33\n\n$11.12\n\n$0.478003\n\n$83,170.00\n\n$0.796451\n\n$0.488917\n\n$1,401.43\n\n$1,951.07\n\n$0.463798\n\n$1,873.28\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.068896\n\n$131.75\n\n$0.574239\n\n$68.85\n\n$17.34\n\n$0.802314\n\n$0.63669\n\n$0.999013\n\n$2,122.22\n\n$0.997803\n\n$0.00001165\n\n$0.183693\n\n$8.97\n\n$0.998967\n\n$0.091555\n\n$0.862541\n\n$7.85\n\n$0.559087\n\n$0.998641\n\n$0.01312797\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.893355\n\n$82,841.00\n\n$3,110.13\n\n$0.998579\n\n$1,988.62\n\n$606.02\n\n$0.01578121\n\n$0.662504\n\n$0.00000068\n\n$3,100.09\n\n$0.274886\n\n$83,363.00\n\n$2.15\n\n$0.176007\n\n$32.28\n\n$0.480501\n\n$0.999743\n\n$161.92\n\n$0.103488\n\n$0.384411\n\n$1.97\n\n$7.90\n\n$0.00006019\n\n$1,952.41\n\n$35.85\n\n$0.01128311\n\n$3.03\n\n$0.147397\n\n$16.13\n\n$138.60\n\n$0.421575\n\n$0.999617\n\n$0.075941\n\n$1.75\n\n$0.666421\n\n$0.999376\n\n$0.999531\n\n$2.99\n\n$81,367.00\n\n$16.67\n\n$0.999115\n\n$0.00506741\n\n$0.248375\n\n$1.68\n\n$0.425497\n\n$27.99\n\n$6.40\n\n$1,987.34\n\n$0.475139\n\n$0.716174\n\n$0.172473\n\n$0.441629\n\n$6.65\n\n$1,876.20\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$83,258.00\n\n$84,134.00\n\n$2.61\n\n$0.418879\n\n$0.152282\n\n$0.082106\n\n$1,876.47\n\n$0.999329\n\n$1.08\n\n$1,874.79\n\n$0.619264\n\n$0.401924\n\n$0.04205501\n\n$0.00002009\n\n$1.13\n\n$0.48988\n\n$110.49\n\n$0.486743\n\n$1.096\n\n$0.00738803\n\n$0.00603742\n\n$1,956.54\n\n$0.00665929\n\n$83,345.00\n\n$0.203817\n\n$0.862599\n\n$40.20\n\n$0.372763\n\n$0.99915\n\n$0.998979\n\n$0.0040401\n\n$0.999196\n\n$0.00000165\n\n$1,886.76\n\n$82,752.00\n\n$1,871.36\n\n$0.166762\n\n$0.00005984\n\n$0.999808\n\n$1.35\n\n$122.32\n\n$0.03182287\n\n$0.0094442\n\n$0.0314225\n\n$1.26\n\n$0.24911\n\n$0.261209\n\n$1,857.48\n\n$3.81\n\n$0.00049822\n\n$0.539469\n\n$2.66\n\n$0.669373\n\n$1.38\n\n$1,877.30\n\n$2.89\n\n$0.793969\n\n$83,275.00\n\n$82,683.00\n\n$21.95\n\n$0.193816\n\n$2,052.28\n\n$0.09081\n\n$1,980.61\n\n$1.097\n\n$16.15\n\n$0.259853\n\n$3,083.14\n\n$0.06842\n\n$0.03632611\n\n$0.03134473\n\n$2,038.54\n\n$0.106938\n\n$0.484117\n\n$0.00323003\n\n$0.11746\n\n$0.00232241\n\n$0.03101224\n\n$0.523739\n\n$1,870.47\n\n$0.956734\n\n$0.999709\n\n$1,676.92\n\n$0.00491848\n\n$0.666713\n\n$0.01138476\n\n$0.533371\n\n$0.302896\n\n$20.18\n\n$0.0024779\n\n$2.17\n\n$0.999445\n\n$0.0023811\n\n$0.9983\n\nKalshi has relaunched its betting pools based on U.S. election outcomes—the latest development in a convoluted legal drama that wreaked havoc on the prediction market operator's business strategy last month.\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday lifted a weeks-long freeze on Kalshi's U.S. elections-based prediction markets.\nKalshi briefly launched prediction markets based on the U.S. elections on September 12.

The regulator called for both companies to stop allowing New Jersey residents to place bets on athletics events and void existing sports-related wagers from people living there.\n\nRobinhood and Kalshi must comply with the order by the end of March 28 or face enforcement actions, according to the letter.\n\nKalshi has relaunched its betting pools based on U.S. election outcomes—the latest development in a convoluted legal drama that wreaked havoc on the prediction market operator's business strategy last month.\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday lifted a weeks-long freeze on Kalshi's U.S. elections-based prediction markets.\nKalshi briefly launched prediction markets based on the U.S. elections on September 12. However, the firm shuttered those markets shortly after that on the orders of a higher...\n\n“This letter shall serve as official notice that Robinhood [and Kalshi], by facilitating and/or accepting unauthorized sports wagering from individuals within the State of New Jersey, is engaging in activity that is unlawful under not only New Jersey law, but New Jersey’s Constitution,” NJGDE Interim Director Mary Jo Flaherty said in the letter.\n\nThe state regulator added that the trading platforms’ actions violate the New Jersey Sports Wagering Act, which “only permits licensed entities to offer sports wagering to patrons located in New Jersey.”\n\nNearly two weeks ago, Robinhood launched its March Madness prediction markets powered by Kalshi to capitalize on traders’ growing appetites for sports betting. Legal sports wagers exceeded $140 billion in 2024, up roughly 23% from the year prior, CBS Sports reported.\n\nHowever, prediction market operators such as Kalshi have encountered several regulatory obstacles as they aim to address that growing market.\n\nEarlier this month, Kalshi received orders from regulators in Nevada to stop offering derivatives trading on professional and college athletics events in the state. And this week, Barrons reported Washington state regulators are considering issuing Kalshi a similar directive.\n\n\"Event contracts offered by Robinhood Derivatives are federally regulated by the CFTC and offered through CFTC-registered entities, assuring that retail customers can access these prediction markets in a safe and regulated manner,\" Robinhood said through a spokesperson. \"While we do not believe these contracts run afoul of any state laws, we are no longer allowing New Jersey residents to enter new positions for the Men’s and Women’s Basketball Tournament event contacts.”\n\nA Kalshi spokesperson told Decrypt that the company might comment later.\n\nEdited by James Rubin\n\nHaliey Welch, better known online as the girl behind “Hawk Tuah,” isn’t worried about the Securities and Exchange Commission’s probe into her meme coin anymore after the agency dropped the investigation, she said Friday.\n“For the past few months, I've been cooperating with all the authorities and attorneys, and finally, that work is complete,” she told TMZ.\nWelch launched a meme coin on Solana in December that quickly imploded, sparking backlash and forcing her to temporarily take her account of...\n\nThe New York Attorney General and Galaxy Digital have agreed to a settlement over the crypto firm’s handling of the collapsed Terra LUNA cryptocurrency, with the agreement requiring Galaxy to pay $200 million for alleged violations of the Martin Act and New York Executive Law. \nA 49-page filing from the Office of the Attorney General of New York (OAG) outlines the investigation and the Office’s conclusions, alleging that “Galaxy’s conduct, including its misrepresentations and omissions about LUN...\n\nThree co-founders of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX—Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed—were pardoned by President Trump on Friday, according to a report from CNBC.\nAll three founders pled guilty in 2022 to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to operate an anti-money laundering program at the cryptocurrency exchange.

    "full_content": "# Galaxy Digital Agrees to $200 Million Settlement Over LUNA 'Misrepresentations'\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nThe New York Attorney General and Galaxy Digital have agreed to a settlement over the crypto firm’s handling of the collapsed Terra LUNA cryptocurrency, with the agreement requiring Galaxy to pay $200 million for alleged violations of the Martin Act and New York Executive Law.\n\nA 49-page filing from the Office of the Attorney General of New York (OAG) outlines the investigation and the Office’s conclusions, alleging that “Galaxy’s conduct, including its misrepresentations and omissions about LUNA while simultaneously selling LUNA and failing to disclose its then-present intent to sell, constituted violations” of the above laws.\n\n“This was not an easy decision and one that we considered carefully. Settling this matter will help Galaxy move forward and minimize distractions so that we can focus on our mission of driving innovation and growth in digital assets and artificial intelligence infrastructure,” said Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz, in a statement.\n\nThe Terra ecosystem collapse in 2022 didn't make as many headlines as FTX, but the total number of victims could exceed 1 million, according to new court documents.\nThe documents filed this week allege that the number of victims of disgraced crypto mogul, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon, is “difficult to precisely quantify.”\nKwon last week pleaded not guilty in a New York court to U.S. criminal charges including fraud over the collapse of the Terra crypto ecosystem. His crypto project went up in...\n\nNovogratz’s firm initially purchased more than 18.5 million LUNA tokens for $0.22 per token, a 30% discount from the spot price in October 2020 as part of an agreement with Terraform Labs.\n\nThe OAG’s findings indicate that a Galaxy memo sent on the same day of the agreement proposed that as part of the trade, “Galaxy would make the public more aware of the Terra ecosystem.”\n\nLater public awareness, particularly from Novogratz, is central to the findings outlined by the OAG, which highlight his personal promotion of Terraform Labs’ LUNA token through posts on X (formerly Twitter), podcast interviews, and even via a tattoo that he promised to get if LUNA reached $100.\n\n“But while Novogratz posted pictures of his tattoo and expressed his LUNA bullishness to the public, Galaxy sold millions of tokens into the market at many multiples of its initial cost without disclosing that it was selling,” the filing reads.\n\npic.twitter.com/GBZ6qq4kdr\n\n— Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) January 5, 2022\n\nShortly after getting his tattoo, the OAG’s findings showed that Novogratz’ firm netted more than $100 million via LUNA token sales from January 5-13, 2022, despite the fact that he urged his social media followers to “keep the faith” as LUNA fell from its $100 mark.\n\nMarkets always consolidate after huge moves.  100 was a symbolic number.  Corresponded with 10bn in $UST.  I’d expect consolidation before the next leg up.   Watch activity.  Watch stable coin growth.  Watch new projects.  If they grow so will $LUNA.   Keep the faith🌕\n\n— Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) January 5, 2022\n\nThe OAG findings note that the firm sold more LUNA tokens throughout January and February, leaving it with only “2,060 LUNA as of February 28, 2022.”\n\nIn March 2022, Galaxy Digital Research noted a known risk in the LUNA token that could result in a “death spiral” for the first time.\n\nTwo months later, that death spiral appeared. Terraform Labs’ algorithmic TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its 1:1 peg to the U.S. Dollar and the LUNA token collapsed alongside, ultimately leading the formerly top 10 token to trade for less than 1 cent, greatly impacting cryptocurrency investors worldwide.\n\nAlleged crypto crook Do Kwon pleaded pleaded not guilty in a New York court Thursday to U.S. criminal charges over the 2022 collapse of the Terra crypto ecosystem, following his extradition earlier this week from Montenegro.\nFeds hit the 33-year-old disgraced tech entrepreneur with nine criminal counts, including securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He agreed Thursday to be held without bail before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger, In...\n\nAs part of the Assurance of Discontinuation filing, Galaxy did not admit to or deny the findings. In addition to the $200 million payment, which must be made over the next three years, Galaxy must also create and maintain policies and procedures regarding public statements on cryptocurrencies that it may have interest in.\n\nEarlier this year, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon pleaded not guilty to U.S. criminal charges over the Terra ecosystem collapse.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\n$83,374.00\n\n$1,874.82\n\n$2.10\n\n$606.91\n\n$126.49\n\n$0.99993\n\n$0.172687\n\n$0.677656\n\n$0.234599\n\n$1,874.58\n\n$83,262.00\n\n$3.70\n\n$9.69\n\n$13.86\n\n$20.01\n\n$0.267839\n\n$2,244.50\n\n$1.00\n\n$2.38\n\n$0.00001282\n\n$0.172899\n\n$86.22\n\n$4.12\n\n$6.31\n\n$306.15\n\n$0.828962\n\n$4.66\n\n$1,876.45\n\n$0.999505\n\n$0.997399\n\n$12.68\n\n$1,993.21\n\n$28.53\n\n$216.67\n\n$6.11\n\n$5.41\n\n$0.0000076\n\n$2.65\n\n$1.045\n\n$48.86\n\n$35.96\n\n$22.68\n\n$0.101779\n\n$0.80764\n\n$83,479.00\n\n$177.92\n\n$5.45\n\n$0.999283\n\n$16.90\n\n$0.805098\n\n$1.16\n\n$10.11\n\n$0.02319676\n\n$232.85\n\n$0.373276\n\n$4.45\n\n$1.00\n\n$3.27\n\n$3.62\n\n$2.80\n\n$83,166.00\n\n$0.203716\n\n$4.02\n\n$0.064872\n\n$0.187004\n\n$0.500733\n\n$0.338297\n\n$5.33\n\n$11.12\n\n$0.478003\n\n$83,170.00\n\n$0.796451\n\n$0.488917\n\n$1,401.43\n\n$1,951.07\n\n$0.463798\n\n$1,873.28\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.068896\n\n$131.75\n\n$0.574239\n\n$68.85\n\n$17.34\n\n$0.802314\n\n$0.63669\n\n$0.999013\n\n$2,122.22\n\n$0.997803\n\n$0.00001165\n\n$0.183693\n\n$8.97\n\n$0.998967\n\n$0.091555\n\n$0.862541\n\n$7.85\n\n$0.559087\n\n$0.998641\n\n$0.01312797\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.893355\n\n$82,841.00\n\n$3,110.13\n\n$0.998579\n\n$1,988.62\n\n$606.02\n\n$0.01578121\n\n$0.662504\n\n$0.00000068\n\n$3,100.09\n\n$0.274886\n\n$83,363.00\n\n$2.15\n\n$0.176007\n\n$32.28\n\n$0.480501\n\n$0.999743\n\n$161.92\n\n$0.103488\n\n$0.384411\n\n$1.97\n\n$7.90\n\n$0.00006019\n\n$1,952.41\n\n$35.85\n\n$0.01128311\n\n$3.03\n\n$0.147397\n\n$16.13\n\n$138.60\n\n$0.421575\n\n$0.999617\n\n$0.075941\n\n$1.75\n\n$0.666421\n\n$0.999376\n\n$0.999531\n\n$2.99\n\n$81,367.00\n\n$16.67\n\n$0.999115\n\n$0.00506741\n\n$0.248375\n\n$1.68\n\n$0.425497\n\n$27.99\n\n$6.40\n\n$1,987.34\n\n$0.475139\n\n$0.716174\n\n$0.172473\n\n$0.441629\n\n$6.65\n\n$1,876.20\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$83,258.00\n\n$84,134.00\n\n$2.61\n\n$0.418879\n\n$0.152282\n\n$0.082106\n\n$1,876.47\n\n$0.999329\n\n$1.08\n\n$1,874.79\n\n$0.619264\n\n$0.401924\n\n$0.04205501\n\n$0.00002009\n\n$1.13\n\n$0.48988\n\n$110.49\n\n$0.486743\n\n$1.096\n\n$0.00738803\n\n$0.00603742\n\n$1,956.54\n\n$0.00665929\n\n$83,345.00\n\n$0.203817\n\n$0.862599\n\n$40.20\n\n$0.372763\n\n$0.99915\n\n$0.998979\n\n$0.0040401\n\n$0.999196\n\n$0.00000165\n\n$1,886.76\n\n$82,752.00\n\n$1,871.36\n\n$0.166762\n\n$0.00005984\n\n$0.999808\n\n$1.35\n\n$122.32\n\n$0.03182287\n\n$0.0094442\n\n$0.0314225\n\n$1.26\n\n$0.24911\n\n$0.261209\n\n$1,857.48\n\n$3.81\n\n$0.00049822\n\n$0.539469\n\n$2.66\n\n$0.669373\n\n$1.38\n\n$1,877.30\n\n$2.89\n\n$0.793969\n\n$83,275.00\n\n$82,683.00\n\n$21.95\n\n$0.193816\n\n$2,052.28\n\n$0.09081\n\n$1,980.61\n\n$1.097\n\n$16.15\n\n$0.259853\n\n$3,083.14\n\n$0.06842\n\n$0.03632611\n\n$0.03134473\n\n$2,038.54\n\n$0.106938\n\n$0.484117\n\n$0.00323003\n\n$0.11746\n\n$0.00232241\n\n$0.03101224\n\n$0.523739\n\n$1,870.47\n\n$0.956734\n\n$0.999709\n\n$1,676.92\n\n$0.00491848\n\n$0.666713\n\n$0.01138476\n\n$0.533371\n\n$0.302896\n\n$20.18\n\n$0.0024779\n\n$2.17\n\n$0.999445\n\n$0.0023811\n\n$0.9983\n\nThe Terra ecosystem collapse in 2022 didn't make as many headlines as FTX, but the total number of victims could exceed 1 million, according to new court documents.\nThe documents filed this week allege that the number of victims of disgraced crypto mogul, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon, is “difficult to precisely quantify.”\nKwon last week pleaded not guilty in a New York court to U.S. criminal charges including fraud over the collapse of the Terra crypto ecosystem.

This week: GameStop makes a big splash with its Bitcoin announcement, then fumbles with a debt offering; BTC miners are in for a world of hurt as fees shrink; and Robinhood gets a New Jersey slap on the wrist for its prediction market debut.\n\nGameStop presses play on Bitcoin\n\nThere was a lot of excitement for GameStop’s Q4 earnings report because it was heavily hinted—and then confirmed—that the company was going to start buying Bitcoin.\n\n(There’s a rapidly growing list of publicly traded companies that buy Bitcoin.)\n\nThe video game retailer, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the GME ticker, reported $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of February 1—up from $921 million the same time last year.\n\nBut instead of using a portion of that cash to buy Bitcoin, it’s raising $1.3 billion in a convertible note offering. GME investors are not pleased, but traders are finding a way to profit on the news: Short volume yesterday was the highest it’s been since meme stock influencer Roaring Kitty made his return last summer.\n\nVideo game retailer GameStop said on Wednesday that it plans to offer up to $1.3 billion worth of convertible senior notes to investors, taking a page straight out of Strategy's Bitcoin-buying playbook.\nThe Texas-based firm said in a press release that proceeds from the sale will be used for \"general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin.\" The announcement comes one day after GameStop said it could purchase Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset following an update to the company...\n\nMeanwhile, GME has erased its BTC bump and sank near a six-month low. By Friday afternoon, the price of GME was hovering around $22 and had lost 12.9% over the past five days.\n\nInvestors have noted on X, formerly Twitter, that more than 71% of GME volume is being traded off exchanges in dark pools. This is how institutional investors, like hedge funds, mutual funds, and pensions carry out large transactions without having to immediately disclose them publicly.\n\nThe incredible, shrinking Bitcoin fees\n\nTroubling news for miners: Bitcoin transaction fees have been shrinking.\n\nBlocksBridge Consulting noted in its newsletter this week that transaction fees now make up only 1.25% of total block rewards. That’s the lowest it’s been since April 2022.\n\n“Without a significant uptick in Bitcoin’s market price or a revival in transaction fees, these miners may soon face an unmanageable situation: they may no longer be able to compete,” BlockBridge analysts wrote.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market, are in the throes of a rout. The global crypto market cap has sunk by 5.5% in the past 24 hours and the price of Bitcoin is down 3.7% to $83,804.62, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nAs Bitcoin mining grows more competitive and challenging, industry leaders are looking to cash in on AI data centers—but it’s no easy feat. \nAt the Mining Disrupt conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida this week, leading miners said navigating the shift to AI requires skill and care. \n“In the long-term, [AI] is a big trend,” Paul Li, CEO of mining technology provider Fog Hashing, said during a talk. “We cannot miss that. You [miners] need to go far this year, as the demand for compute power AI c...\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin miners told Decrypt at a conference earlier this week that pivoting data warehouses to serve high-performance computing and AI clients has come with its own set of challenges.\n\nFor starters, Bitcoin miners can—and often do—turn their rigs off to save money. But that doesn’t fly when you’re handling workloads for AI startups.\n\n“We’re interruptible [as Bitcoin miners], whereas a traditional data center needs [to be] on 100% of the time,” Shanon Squires from Compass Mining told Decrypt, adding that this ups costs big time.\n\nPaging CoreWeave quote\n\nSpeaking of Bitcoin miners pivoting to AI, Nvidia-backed AI hyperscaler CoreWeave began trading on the Nasdaq under the CRWV ticker—or so we were told.\n\n(Remember: CoreWeave, began as a crypto miner focused on Ethereum in 2019, before gradually pivoting to AI as Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake consensus in 2022 and rendered Ethereum miners obsolete.)\n\nThe company’s CEO rang the opening bell on Friday to mark the IPO, which priced shares at $40 and sought to raise $1.5 billion. For a time, it was expected that CRWV would raise up to $2.7 billion with price estimates as high as $55 per share.\n\nBut for the better part of the day, it was impossible to find a stock quote for CRWV. And when it did show up, around 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time, the share price had fallen 5.5% to $37.81. But it recovered slightly and looked to be ending its first day of trading having gained 2.4%.\n\nWell...we're waiting. $CRWV pic.twitter.com/G4qqg4oQHL\n\n— Nobody Special (@JG_Nuke) March 28, 2025\n\nAn unnamed person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that three unnamed investors bought half of the $1.5 billion offering. And Nvidia was rumored to snap up $250 million worth of the offering. In other words, a handful of wealthy people juiced the IPO to make it appear more successful than it otherwise would have been, according to Bloomberg's reporting.\n\nOne of the issues analysts have flagged with CRWV is the background of its founders. As Matt Turck, partner at venture capital firm FirstMark, put it on X, they come from a financial, rather than technological, background.\n\nBut even with two finance co-founders, the financials haven’t looked great.\n\n“CoreWeave remains deeply unprofitable”, Turck wrote in a blog post.“ It incurred a net loss of $31M in 2022, which widened to $593.7 million in 2023 and  $863.4 million in 2024​ (-45% margin). In other words, expenses grew almost as fast as revenue – the 2024 net loss was about 45% of revenue (an improvement from 2023, when the net loss exceeded 2× annual revenue).”\n\nTime out for Robinhood?\n\nFirst, the good news: Robinhood put some extra shine on its Gold premium membership earlier this week.\n\nThe crypto and stock trading platform, which trades on the Nasdaq under the HOOD ticker, is  now going to include access to Robinhood Strategies, which aims to deliver \"tailor, expert-managed portfolios,” tickets to exclusive events such as the Oscars, private jet travel, and same-day delivery of cash direct to a customer's doorstep.\n\nThis led Bernstein analysts to set a $105 price target for HOOD—more than double the company’s current share price of $41.65.\n\nRobinhood has launched a prediction market that will allow users to bet on this year's March Madness basketball tournament—the latest sign event derivatives are gaining traction in the U.S. despite ongoing regulatory challenges.  \nBeginning Monday, Robinhood users can place wagers on the National Collegiate Athletic Association's March Madness tournament, which runs from mid-March to early April. \nThe prediction markets are powered by Kalshi, a startup that fought and won its legal battle agains...\n\nBut, according to The Closing Line, state regulators have a problem with another recent update from the company: Its sports prediction markets.\n\nThe New Jersey Division of Gaming and Entertainment sent a letter to the companies, alleging the markets are “unauthorised sports wagering services” and should not be available to state residents.\n\nMidnight tonight is the deadline for Kalshi and Robinhood to acknowledge receipt of the letter and shut off access for New Jersey residents. At approximately 3 p.m. Eastern Time, this New Jersey resident could still see the markets in her Robinhood app.\n\nOther keys\n\nTrading platform eToro, which paired its crypto offerings back to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash as part of an SEC settlement, is now making a run for an initial public offering. But it remains to be seen whether eToro will bring back crypto to lure in new users.\n\nBut having been on- and off-again with most crypto assets doesn’t seem to have hurt its performance.\n\nIn its SEC filing, the company reported that crypto accounted for 38% of the company’s commissions, up from 17% the year before. And total commissions grew to $931 million, up 46% from $639 million in 2023.\n\nCould this be the bull that leads current tech IPO season?\n\n$83,374.00\n\n$1,874.82\n\n$2.10\n\n$606.91\n\n$126.49\n\n$0.99993\n\n$0.172687\n\n$0.677656\n\n$0.234599\n\n$1,874.58\n\n$83,262.00\n\n$3.70\n\n$9.69\n\n$13.86\n\n$20.01\n\n$0.267839\n\n$2,244.50\n\n$1.00\n\n$2.38\n\n$0.00001282\n\n$0.172899\n\n$86.22\n\n$4.12\n\n$6.31\n\n$306.15\n\n$0.828962\n\n$4.66\n\n$1,876.45\n\n$0.999505\n\n$0.997399\n\n$12.68\n\n$1,993.21\n\n$28.53\n\n$216.67\n\n$6.11\n\n$5.41\n\n$0.0000076\n\n$2.65\n\n$1.045\n\n$48.86\n\n$35.96\n\n$22.68\n\n$0.101779\n\n$0.80764\n\n$83,479.00\n\n$177.92\n\n$5.45\n\n$0.999283\n\n$16.90\n\n$0.805098\n\n$1.16\n\n$10.11\n\n$0.02319676\n\n$232.85\n\n$0.373276\n\n$4.45\n\n$1.00\n\n$3.27\n\n$3.62\n\n$2.80\n\n$83,166.00\n\n$0.203716\n\n$4.02\n\n$0.064872\n\n$0.187004\n\n$0.500733\n\n$0.338297\n\n$5.33\n\n$11.12\n\n$0.478003\n\n$83,170.00\n\n$0.796451\n\n$0.488917\n\n$1,401.43\n\n$1,951.07\n\n$0.463798\n\n$1,873.28\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.068896\n\n$131.75\n\n$0.574239\n\n$68.85\n\n$17.34\n\n$0.802314\n\n$0.63669\n\n$0.999013\n\n$2,122.22\n\n$0.997803\n\n$0.00001165\n\n$0.183693\n\n$8.97\n\n$0.998967\n\n$0.091555\n\n$0.862541\n\n$7.85\n\n$0.559087\n\n$0.998641\n\n$0.01312797\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.893355\n\n$82,841.00\n\n$3,110.13\n\n$0.998579\n\n$1,988.62\n\n$606.02\n\n$0.01578121\n\n$0.662504\n\n$0.00000068\n\n$3,100.09\n\n$0.274886\n\n$83,363.00\n\n$2.15\n\n$0.176007\n\n$32.28\n\n$0.480501\n\n$0.999743\n\n$161.92\n\n$0.103488\n\n$0.384411\n\n$1.97\n\n$7.90\n\n$0.00006019\n\n$1,952.41\n\n$35.85\n\n$0.01128311\n\n$3.03\n\n$0.147397\n\n$16.13\n\n$138.60\n\n$0.421575\n\n$0.999617\n\n$0.075941\n\n$1.75\n\n$0.666421\n\n$0.999376\n\n$0.999531\n\n$2.99\n\n$81,367.00\n\n$16.67\n\n$0.999115\n\n$0.00506741\n\n$0.248375\n\n$1.68\n\n$0.425497\n\n$27.99\n\n$6.40\n\n$1,987.34\n\n$0.475139\n\n$0.716174\n\n$0.172473\n\n$0.441629\n\n$6.65\n\n$1,876.20\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$83,258.00\n\n$84,134.00\n\n$2.61\n\n$0.418879\n\n$0.152282\n\n$0.082106\n\n$1,876.47\n\n$0.999329\n\n$1.08\n\n$1,874.79\n\n$0.619264\n\n$0.401924\n\n$0.04205501\n\n$0.00002009\n\n$1.13\n\n$0.48988\n\n$110.49\n\n$0.486743\n\n$1.096\n\n$0.00738803\n\n$0.00603742\n\n$1,956.54\n\n$0.00665929\n\n$83,345.00\n\n$0.203817\n\n$0.862599\n\n$40.20\n\n$0.372763\n\n$0.99915\n\n$0.998979\n\n$0.0040401\n\n$0.999196\n\n$0.00000165\n\n$1,886.76\n\n$82,752.00\n\n$1,871.36\n\n$0.166762\n\n$0.00005984\n\n$0.999808\n\n$1.35\n\n$122.32\n\n$0.03182287\n\n$0.0094442\n\n$0.0314225\n\n$1.26\n\n$0.24911\n\n$0.261209\n\n$1,857.48\n\n$3.81\n\n$0.00049822\n\n$0.539469\n\n$2.66\n\n$0.669373\n\n$1.38\n\n$1,877.30\n\n$2.89\n\n$0.793969\n\n$83,275.00\n\n$82,683.00\n\n$21.95\n\n$0.193816\n\n$2,052.28\n\n$0.09081\n\n$1,980.61\n\n$1.097\n\n$16.15\n\n$0.259853\n\n$3,083.14\n\n$0.06842\n\n$0.03632611\n\n$0.03134473\n\n$2,038.54\n\n$0.106938\n\n$0.484117\n\n$0.00323003\n\n$0.11746\n\n$0.00232241\n\n$0.03101224\n\n$0.523739\n\n$1,870.47\n\n$0.956734\n\n$0.999709\n\n$1,676.92\n\n$0.00491848\n\n$0.666713\n\n$0.01138476\n\n$0.533371\n\n$0.302896\n\n$20.18\n\n$0.0024779\n\n$2.17\n\n$0.999445\n\n$0.0023811\n\n$0.9983\n\nVideo game retailer GameStop said on Wednesday that it plans to offer up to $1.3 billion worth of convertible senior notes to investors, taking a page straight out of Strategy's Bitcoin-buying playbook.\nThe Texas-based firm said in a press release that proceeds from the sale will be used for \"general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin.\" The announcement comes one day after GameStop said it could purchase Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset following an update to the company...\n\nAs Bitcoin mining grows more competitive and challenging, industry leaders are looking to cash in on AI data centers—but it’s no easy feat. \nAt the Mining Disrupt conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida this week, leading miners said navigating the shift to AI requires skill and care. \n“In the long-term, [AI] is a big trend,” Paul Li, CEO of mining technology provider Fog Hashing, said during a talk. “We cannot miss that.

It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.\n\nOther top coins have shown sharper losses over the past day, however, with Ethereum down 6% to $1,875 and XRP falling about 7% to $2.17. Both fell to weekly lows on Friday alongside Bitcoin.\n\nSolana and Dogecoin are also in the red Friday, down 6% and 4.5% respectively over the past day, though both coins remain up over the last week.\n\nAmid the declines, crypto liquidations have surged over the past day, tallying more than $450 million as of this writing per data from CoinGlass. Long positions make up the bulk of the carnage at $402 million, and Ethereum is the biggest contributor to liquidations with $136 million worth in total. Bitcoin is next at $118 million.\n\nBoth the Dow and S&P 500 indices are down more than 2% Friday, with traders reacting to continued inflation fears and the impact of Trump's ever-evolving trade tariffs on other nations.

    "full_content": "# Bitcoin Reserve ‘Crucial’ for Brazil's Prosperity: Lula Administration\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nA high-ranking official in Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration declared Tuesday that a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve would be \"determinant for our prosperity\" and \"in the (country’s) public interest.\"\n\nPedro Giocondo Guerra, chief of staff to Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, made the remarks while officially representing the federal government at a congressional ceremony.\n\nDebating the establishment of a sovereign bitcoin reserve rigorously is a matter of public interest and will be crucial for our prosperity,” Guerra said according to local media outlet Poder360. “Bitcoin is digital gold—the gold of the internet. It is a technology that allows wealth to be transferred across the globe swiftly and enables us to store the fruits of our labor efficiently and securely.”\n\nThe statement underscored the country’s heightened interest in Bitcoin amid a growing list of countries that have made it part of their political strategies.\n\nGuerra’s comments came shortly after deputy Eros Biondini (PL-MG) introduced legislation proposing the creation of a \"Strategic Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve\" (RESBit). That bill would mandate the government acquire Bitcoin up to 5% of Brazil's international reserves, with the Brazilian Central Bank handling custody using advanced monitoring systems and blockchain technology and AI to monitor transactions.\n\nThe first spot exchange-traded fund based on XRP’s ongoing price will soon begin trading—just not in the U.S. \nThe Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund has launched in a pre-operational phase and will debut on Brazil’s B3 exchange after the country’s financial investments regulator greenlit the ETF on Wednesday. Crypto asset manager Hashdex has not yet specified a start date. \nThe fund’s approval comes as issuers worldwide aim to address surging demand for crypto-focused investments, amid a more favora...\n\nBrazil's existing crypto landscape is already robust. The country started approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs before any other nation in the Americas and offers diverse investment vehicles. These include FOMO11, which tracks market sentiment, DEFI11 for a basket of DeFi coins, HASH11, one of the most traded ETFs in the Brazilian market, and even a Solana spot ETF approved on august 2024.\n\nThe proposed legislation outlines multiple objectives for the Bitcoin reserve. These include diversifying the National Treasury's financial assets, protecting international reserves against currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks, promoting blockchain technology adoption across public and private sectors, and providing backing for Brazil's controversial CBDC, the DREX.\n\nIf approved, the bill would require the government to implement the reserve gradually while adhering to fiscal responsibility laws and ensuring public account stability. The legislation also mandates transparent management with biannual reports to Congress.\n\nThe bill must still navigate the full legislative process, requiring approval from various committees, passage in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and finally presidential approval or veto.\n\nAccording to Biondini's proposal, the Bitcoin reserve would position Brazil \"at the forefront of the digital economy\" and increase the country's economic resilience by reducing exposure to currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks.\n\nThe bill references Brazil's high adoption rate of cryptocurrencies, noting that in 2022, approximately 16% of the Brazilian population reported having used or owned crypto assets according to research by Finder.

It is a technology that allows wealth to be transferred across the globe swiftly and enables us to store the fruits of our labor efficiently and securely.”\n\nThe statement underscored the country’s heightened interest in Bitcoin amid a growing list of countries that have made it part of their political strategies.\n\nGuerra’s comments came shortly after deputy Eros Biondini (PL-MG) introduced legislation proposing the creation of a \"Strategic Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve\" (RESBit). That bill would mandate the government acquire Bitcoin up to 5% of Brazil's international reserves, with the Brazilian Central Bank handling custody using advanced monitoring systems and blockchain technology and AI to monitor transactions.\n\nThe first spot exchange-traded fund based on XRP’s ongoing price will soon begin trading—just not in the U.S. \nThe Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund has launched in a pre-operational phase and will debut on Brazil’s B3 exchange after the country’s financial investments regulator greenlit the ETF on Wednesday.

The country started approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs before any other nation in the Americas and offers diverse investment vehicles. These include FOMO11, which tracks market sentiment, DEFI11 for a basket of DeFi coins, HASH11, one of the most traded ETFs in the Brazilian market, and even a Solana spot ETF approved on august 2024.\n\nThe proposed legislation outlines multiple objectives for the Bitcoin reserve. These include diversifying the National Treasury's financial assets, protecting international reserves against currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks, promoting blockchain technology adoption across public and private sectors, and providing backing for Brazil's controversial CBDC, the DREX.\n\nIf approved, the bill would require the government to implement the reserve gradually while adhering to fiscal responsibility laws and ensuring public account stability. The legislation also mandates transparent management with biannual reports to Congress.\n\nThe bill must still navigate the full legislative process, requiring approval from various committees, passage in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and finally presidential approval or veto.\n\nAccording to Biondini's proposal, the Bitcoin reserve would position Brazil \"at the forefront of the digital economy\" and increase the country's economic resilience by reducing exposure to currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks.\n\nThe bill references Brazil's high adoption rate of cryptocurrencies, noting that in 2022, approximately 16% of the Brazilian population reported having used or owned crypto assets according to research by Finder. It argues this widespread adoption should be reflected in government strategy to avoid putting the country at a disadvantage internationally.\n\nEl Salvador famously declared Bitcoin legal tender and has been acquiring one Bitcoin daily for its national reserves, reportedly generating significant profits through the asset's appreciation.
