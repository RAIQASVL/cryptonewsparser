    "full_content": "# Robinhood Sweetens Gold Membership as Bernstein Sets $105 Price Target\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 27, 2025\n\nRobinhood launched a slew of new services for Gold members, which could further blur the lines between fiat and crypto.\n\nGold, the trading app's premium subscription, costs $5 a month or $50 a year, with 4% interest on uninvested cash and higher thresholds for instant deposits.\n\nAt a presentation in San Francisco on Wednesday, the company unveiled Robinhood Strategies, which aims to deliver \"tailor, expert-managed portfolios\" driven by a team that collectively have over 50 years of Wall Street experience serving institutional and high-net-worth investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Robinhood Banking will deliver access to traditional checking and savings accounts, tickets to exclusive events such as the Oscars, private jet travel, and same-day delivery of cash direct to a customer's doorstep.\n\nRobinhood has launched a prediction market that will allow users to bet on this year's March Madness basketball tournament—the latest sign event derivatives are gaining traction in the U.S. despite ongoing regulatory challenges.  \nBeginning Monday, Robinhood users can place wagers on the National Collegiate Athletic Association's March Madness tournament, which runs from mid-March to early April. \nThe prediction markets are powered by Kalshi, a startup that fought and won its legal battle agains...\n\nAn AI-powered investment tool called Robinhood Cortex is also set to deliver \"real-time analysis and insights\" to uncover market opportunities.\n\nThe theme across all three brands is to offer perks once reserved for the \"ultra-wealthy\" to the public at large.”\n\nAnalysts at research firm Bernstein said they think investors “under-appreciate” the value of Robinhood’s full platform, particularly because non-trading activity accounted for 47% of the company’s revenue in 2024.\n\n“HOOD is also leaning into disruptive technologies to bring down the cost of financial access, which has historically been available to only the elite (high net-worth thresholds) within banking,” Bernstein wrote in a report shared with Decrypt. “Crypto tokenisation brings down the cost of offering trading-access, leveraging the blockchain.”\n\nAI16z DAO is flipping the script on how crypto communities invest, govern, and operate—whether for the memes or for the untapped potential of relying on AI to make data-driven, non-subjective financial decisions.\nThe decentralized autonomous organization project, featuring its own token, promises to “flip a16z,” one of Silicon Valley’s premier venture firms, and “redefine what it means to be a venture capitalist in the age of artificial intelligence.”\nAs of this writing, the project's AI16Z toke...\n\nThe analysts said they expect Robinhood shares, which trade on the Nasdaq under the HOOD ticker, to outperform and set a price target of $105.\n\nIt’s a very bullish forecast. At the time of writing, HOOD is trading for $45.23, having gained 1.14% on the day.\n\nYesterday, Robinhood also confirmed the waitlist for its Gold Card is now approaching three million—and this week, another 100,000 customers will start to receive theirs. This product has no annual fee or forex commission, and offers up to 5% cashback on purchases.\n\nThe enhanced Gold program comes as Robinhood looks to expand its crypto offering—emboldened by the SEC ending its investigation into the company.\n\nA 700% surge in revenues from crypto trades helped Robinhood achieve record net income of $916 million in the fourth quarter—ten times higher than the same period in 2023.\n\nAt the time, CEO Vlad Tenev said he believes Robinhood is \"uniquely positioned at the intersection of traditional finance and DeFi.\"\n\nRobinhood Markets reported a 700% surge in cryptocurrency trading revenue in the fourth quarter, helping the retail brokerage post record profitability as digital asset volumes rebounded.\nCrypto revenue reached $358 million, up from $45 million a year earlier, accounting for more than one-third of total transaction-based revenue, which rose over 200% to $672 million. \nThe trading boom pushed total Q4 revenue up 115% year-over-year to $1.01 billion, while net income soared more than tenfold to $9...\n\nBernstein agree, predicting that the company is positioning itself to “capitalize on the impending $114 trillion great wealth transfer, set to occur over the next few decades as wealth passes to younger generations.”\n\nBlending banking services with crypto trading could broaden access to digital assets—and encourage adoption among investors yet to dabble in Bitcoin.\n\nIt could also give Robinhood the upper hand against banks that are yet to start offering crypto products to their clients, despite regulatory clarity slowly beginning to emerge in the U.S.\n\nEdited by Stacy

    "full_content": "# Why GameStop Sold Crypto Before Its Latest Bitcoin Bet\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 27, 2025\n\nGameStop’s announcement on Wednesday that it would sell convertible debt to buy Bitcoin and bolster its balance sheet seems contrary to its past approach to digital assets.\n\nIn recent years, the video game retailer debuted an ill-fated NFT platform and sold large quantities of IMX, the native token of Ethereum layer-2 network Immutable X.\n\nGameStop now appears to be following the path of Bitcoin hodler Strategy, saying it will offer $1.3 billion worth of convertible senior notes and potentially use proceeds to start stockpiling the largest cryptocurrency by market value.\n\nStrategy, which began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020, now holds more than 500,000 Bitcoin worth around $44 billion. In recent years, as it has pivoted its focus from software to becoming a Bitcoin treasury, Strategy has issued billions of dollars of convertible senior notes.\n\nConvertible debt has allowed Strategy to raise capital to purchase more Bitcoin than it could otherwise. The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company unveiled its latest offering of convertible debt in February, raising $2 billion via convertible notes maturing in March 2030.\n\nVideo game retailer GameStop said on Wednesday that it plans to offer up to $1.3 billion worth of convertible senior notes to investors, taking a page straight out of Strategy's Bitcoin-buying playbook.\nThe Texas-based firm said in a press release that proceeds from the sale will be used for \"general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin.\" The announcement comes one day after GameStop said it could purchase Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset following an update to the company...\n\nTo be clear, GameStop has not purchased a single satoshi worth of Bitcoin yet. GameStop's approach to crypto has been more transactional, at least until now.\n\nIt started initially with Ethereum years ago, launching an NFT marketplace in July 2022, which initially lived on the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Loopring. At the time, GameStop had grand visions of cornering the NFT space, specifically for gaming, but the brick-and-mortar retailer started shuttering the platform less than two years later.\n\nWhen GameStop axed its NFT marketplace last January, the company cited “continuing regulatory uncertainty” around digital assets. It vocalized similar concerns when scrapping plans for an NFT-centric digital wallet, part of a complete departure from the crypto space.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, as the company cut ties with crypto, it generated $85 million in proceeds from selling digital assets, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Revenues from GameStop’s NFT marketplace and wallet were “not material,” the company added.\n\nA cryptocurrency called IMX tanked 23% when GameStop sold $47 million worth of the token on the open market in February 2022. GameStop got the funds as part of a contractual agreement with the crypto gaming startup Immutable, which helped launch Immutable X.\n\nGameStop sold its IMX holdings before launching a crypto product. It later expanded its NFT marketplace to support digital collectibles on Immutable X, while also establishing a $100 million fund to incentivize game developers to launch NFTs on its platform through IMX token grants.\n\nIMX’s price peaked around $9.50 over three years ago, according to the crypto market provider CoinGecko.

A few days ago, Fidelity filed...\n\nReading\n\nWhy GameStop Sold Crypto Before Its Latest Bitcoin Bet\n\nGameStop’s announcement on Wednesday that it would sell convertible debt to buy Bitcoin and bolster its balance sheet seems contrary to its past approach to digital assets.\n\nIn recent years, the video game retailer debuted an ill-fated NFT platform and sold large quantities of IMX, the native token of Ethereum layer-2 network Immutable X.\n\nGameStop now appears to be following the path of Bitcoin hodler Strategy, saying it will offer $1.3 billion worth of convertible senior notes and potentially use proceeds to start stockpiling the largest cryptocurrency by market value.\n\nStrategy, which began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020, now holds more than 500,000 Bitcoin worth around $44 billion. In recent years, as it has pivoted its focus from software to becoming a Bitcoin treasury, Strategy has issued billions of dollars of convertible senior notes.\n\nConvertible debt has allowed Strategy to raise capital to purchase more Bitcoin than it could otherwise. The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company unveiled its latest offering of convertible debt in February, raising $2 billion via convertible notes maturing in March 2030.\n\nVideo game retailer GameStop said on Wednesday that it plans to offer up to $1.3 billion worth of convertible senior notes to investors, taking a page straight out of Strategy's Bitcoin-buying playbook.\nThe Texas-based firm said in a press release that proceeds from the sale will be used for \"general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin.\" The announcement comes one day after GameStop said it could purchase Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset following an update to the company...\n\nTo be clear, GameStop has not purchased a single satoshi worth of Bitcoin yet. GameStop's approach to crypto has been more transactional, at least until now.\n\nIt started initially with Ethereum years ago, launching an NFT marketplace in July 2022, which initially lived on the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Loopring. At the time, GameStop had grand visions of cornering the NFT space, specifically for gaming, but the brick-and-mortar retailer started shuttering the platform less than two years later.\n\nWhen GameStop axed its NFT marketplace last January, the company cited “continuing regulatory uncertainty” around digital assets. It vocalized similar concerns when scrapping plans for an NFT-centric digital wallet, part of a complete departure from the crypto space.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, as the company cut ties with crypto, it generated $85 million in proceeds from selling digital assets, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Revenues from GameStop’s NFT marketplace and wallet were “not material,” the company added.\n\nA cryptocurrency called IMX tanked 23% when GameStop sold $47 million worth of the token on the open market in February 2022. GameStop got the funds as part of a contractual agreement with the crypto gaming startup Immutable, which helped launch Immutable X.\n\nGameStop sold its IMX holdings before launching a crypto product. It later expanded its NFT marketplace to support digital collectibles on Immutable X, while also establishing a $100 million fund to incentivize game developers to launch NFTs on its platform through IMX token grants.\n\nIMX’s price peaked around $9.50 over three years ago, according to the crypto market provider CoinGecko. It was recently changing hands around $0.64 on Thursday.\n\nGameStop’s NFT endeavors were guided by former CEO Matt Furlong. He was terminated in July 2023, with Ryan Cohen, the company’s chair, assuming his role.\n\nCohen recently seemed to foreshadow GameStop’s Bitcoin pivot. Last month, he posted a photo to X, formerly Twitter, of him standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who ranks among Bitcoin's top evangelists.\n\nStill, GameStop has said it “may sell any Bitcoin we may acquire.”\n\nEdited by James Rubin\n\nBinance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, who goes by CZ, has introduced a new feature called “Pay to Reach,” allowing users to send direct messages to him for a guaranteed response—but for a price.\nThe initiative, first floated by CZ in a Binance Square post early this month, seeks to address the overwhelming number of messages he receives daily.

    "full_content": "# Binance Founder CZ Is Charging $125 in BNB for Messages on ReachMe\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 27, 2025\n\nBinance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, who goes by CZ, has introduced a new feature called “Pay to Reach,” allowing users to send direct messages to him for a guaranteed response—but for a price.\n\nThe initiative, first floated by CZ in a Binance Square post early this month, seeks to address the overwhelming number of messages he receives daily. In theory, he says it will allow him to streamline communication and reduce spam.\n\nhttps://t.co/TEEwkPQFIa\n\n18 days ago, I published an article in Binance Square on a Pay to Reach idea. A few days later, a developer messaged me with a working prototype. After some discussions, adjustments, and a security review,\n\nYesterday, the product was live. I updated my…\n\n— CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 27, 2025\n\nThe “Pay to Reach” system, launched early hours of the morning, enables users to message CZ and other Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) directly through the platform ReachMe.io.\n\nThe service does not require sign-up and uses Binance’s BNB token as the currency for the transaction.\n\nInitially, CZ set the price at 0.04 BNB, increased it to 0.1 BNB, and later adjusted it again to 0.2 BNB after being flooded with irrelevant and low-effort messages.\n\n“I was spammed at the initial price,\" CZ shared in the announcement tweet. “Please don’t waste your money like that.”\n\n\"I will adjust the price to try to hit a sweet spot of about 10 messages per day,” CZ noted.\n\nhttps://t.co/TEEwkPQFIa\n\n18 days ago, I published an article in Binance Square on a Pay to Reach idea. A few days later, a developer messaged me with a working prototype. After some discussions, adjustments, and a security review,\n\nYesterday, the product was live.

Now, He's Eyeing Another Senate Run\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 27, 2025\n\nPro-XRP lawyer John Deaton may have lost his longshot bid to dethrone anti-crypto Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts last fall, but the former GOP candidate is already considering another Senate run.\n\nThis time he wants to tangle with the state's three-term Junior Sen. Ed Markey.\n\nThe political hopeful—a self-identified pro-abortion independent who only recently allied himself with the Republican Party— believes he can use his newfound “name recognition” to launch a successful campaign against Markey, a beloved career politician with deep roots in New England. The challenge, Deaton told Decrypt, will be convincing digital assets industry donors with deep pockets that a pro-crypto newcomer running on a Republican platform can pull off a major political upset in deep-blue Massachusetts.\n\n“It’s a race I can win, quite frankly,” Deaton said, speaking of a potential matchup against Markey, who plans to run for a fourth Senate term in 2026. But, “it depends if the crypto industry has written off Massachusetts.”\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has demanded that David Sacks, President Donald Trump's Crypto Czar, prove he isn't \"directly profiting off of the Trump Administration’s efforts to selectively pump the value of certain crypto assets.\"\nThe Massachusetts senator laid out her concerns about a conflict of interest in a 6-page letter she made public Friday morning, just hours ahead of a planned crypto summit at the White House.\nEarlier this week, Sacks said he sold all his crypto assets before beginning...\n\nAsked which donors he would like to court during his next potential political run, Deaton named Club for Growth and Fairshake. “Obviously, the big players,” he said.\n\nLast year, crypto industry players emerged as some of the largest corporate donors of the U.S. election cycle, wielding outsized influence on congressional races across the country.\n\nPro-crypto super PAC Fairshake’s $300 million blitz helped catapult more than four dozen digital asset industry allies to victory in congressional races across the country. Since then, the organization has added more than $100 million to its coffers for the 2026 Midterm elections.\n\nThe support of Fairshake, which did not bankroll Deaton in the 2024 election cycle, might help Deaton’s longshot bid to unseat Markey. But to court donors, the political hopeful will first have to prove that he can court the vote.\n\n“No one wants to donate to a lost cause,” Deaton said. “[Donors] are in the data.”\n\nAlthough midterm elections are more than a year away, Deaton is planning to launch an “all-issues” podcast on various kitchen-table topics within the next month—a move that could raise his profile among voters in Massachusetts. The former GOP candidate is also exploring a radio show opportunity with a Massachusetts-based station, he told Decrypt.\n\n“Politically speaking, [there’s this idea that] a Republican will never win so we’re not going to spend any money on them,” Deaton said. But, “if they all see that I can win and get behind it, then we could win.”\n\nAn XRP Lawyer Jumps into the Political Ring\n\nDeaton, a 57-year-old social media personality and XRP holder with nearly 400,000 followers on X, entered the political scene last year, shortly after moving to the Bay State with ambitions of running against Sen. Warren in a race that most critics deemed unwinnable.\n\n“She literally announced her plans to run on an anti-crypto army,” Deaton told Decrypt, adding that Warren had “gaslighted” the crypto community.\n\n“It offended me,” he said. “So I got in the race.”\n\nInitially known to many of his peers in the Massachusetts Republican Party as “that crypto weirdo,” Deaton nevertheless clinched the party’s nomination for the U.S. Senate last fall. He bootstrapped his campaign with a $1 million loan issued by himself, in addition to accepting donations from more than half a dozen crypto industry allies, including Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nThe funds didn’t make much of a difference. “I got beat,” Deaton recalled.\n\nBut Deaton says that challenging Warren was important partly to expose her views on issues where he feels she is out of touch, including digital assets.\n\n“No one was gonna beat her,” Deaton said. “But, I didn’t want her to have a free pass.\n\nAdvocating for Pro-Crypto Policies\n\nDeaton told Decrypt he intends to continue raising his voice on issues that matter within and beyond the crypto community, whether from the halls of Congress or on X.\n\nOn the crypto front, he cited the importance of U.S. regulators enacting more protections for retail investors in a way that supports innovation stateside. He also stressed the need for the crypto community to maintain its focus on “meat and potatoes” issues, such as revamping decades-old securities laws and advancing a crypto markets structure bill through Congress, even as President Donald Trump issues a flurry of executive orders that reduce oversight on the crypto industry.\n\n“I am worried that we’re going from one extreme to the other extreme,” Deaton said on the U.S.’ regulatory environment for crypto. “I love the fact that the boot of the government is off the neck of the industry…let’s make sure that we don’t just go to the other extreme without any real legislation.”\n\nDeaton also shared his thoughts on the Trump-affiliated Official Trump meme coin.\n\n“I really wasn’t a fan of that, personally,” Deaton said.\n\nWhen it launched, “I literally put my head down,” he recalled. “This is just not a good look.”\n\nAsked about Layer-1 blockchain Solana’s conference advertisement that evoked culture war tropes and became the object of ridicule on Crypto Twitter earlier this month, he said, “I think that technology needs to stay as neutral as possible and stay away from politics.”\n\n“For the last four years… the crypto industry has been fighting for its survival,” he added. “The next four years, we’re fighting for our legitimacy.”\n\nEdited by James Rubin\n\n$87,395.00\n\n$2,022.88\n\n$2.36\n\n$638.58\n\n$139.16\n\n$0.999872\n\n$0.19393\n\n$0.73891\n\n$0.232772\n\n$2,021.15\n\n$87,254.00\n\n$15.74\n\n$3.92\n\n$22.13\n\n$9.78\n\n$0.287477\n\n$2,420.07\n\n$2.73\n\n$0.00001438\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.192355\n\n$93.99\n\n$4.62\n\n$6.59\n\n$327.27\n\n$5.03\n\n$2,021.30\n\n$0.817726\n\n$0.998748\n\n$1.00\n\n$14.50\n\n$2,149.09\n\n$29.19\n\n$223.47\n\n$6.82\n\n$0.00000855\n\n$5.95\n\n$3.00\n\n$1.045\n\n$50.20\n\n$6.08\n\n$23.66\n\n$0.918062\n\n$35.80\n\n$0.846627\n\n$185.30\n\n$87,378.00\n\n$0.099686\n\n$18.04\n\n$0.999421\n\n$1.16\n\n$274.76\n\n$0.428329\n\n$0.02637147\n\n$11.19\n\n$3.77\n\n$4.87\n\n$3.97\n\n$0.235787\n\n$0.075893\n\n$3.03\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.613646\n\n$86,926.00\n\n$0.211685\n\n$0.386014\n\n$4.02\n\n$0.546589\n\n$5.77\n\n$0.917212\n\n$0.551658\n\n$11.34\n\n$87,178.00\n\n$2,107.03\n\n$2,021.96\n\n$1,433.10\n\n$0.493863\n\n$1.18\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.645061\n\n$0.958442\n\n$145.40\n\n$0.071388\n\n$0.734511\n\n$76.22\n\n$0.00001399\n\n$0.212877\n\n$10.57\n\n$17.93\n\n$0.999179\n\n$0.106391\n\n$2,289.60\n\n$0.996542\n\n$0.99795\n\n$1.039\n\n$8.45\n\n$0.01462603\n\n$0.576148\n\n$86,689.00\n\n$0.01862746\n\n$0.999803\n\n$2,146.00\n\n$638.62\n\n$0.999754\n\n$0.59062\n\n$0.310933\n\n$0.733846\n\n$3,056.98\n\n$1.00\n\n$2.39\n\n$0.198113\n\n$87,113.00\n\n$35.43\n\n$0.00000071\n\n$2.38\n\n$0.00007087\n\n$177.87\n\n$0.4235\n\n$3,059.03\n\n$0.110667\n\n$0.509609\n\n$1.001\n\n$0.01291909\n\n$2,103.51\n\n$0.170911\n\n$38.78\n\n$0.0010268\n\n$8.48\n\n$18.12\n\n$152.52\n\n$2.01\n\n$3.24\n\n$0.623118\n\n$0.750982\n\n$0.566131\n\n$0.00602994\n\n$3.42\n\n$19.01\n\n$0.999579\n\n$0.528707\n\n$0.01008731\n\n$0.999792\n\n$0.28205\n\n$7.46\n\n$0.075133\n\n$0.474886\n\n$0.194066\n\n$87,374.00\n\n$0.998709\n\n$84,269.00\n\n$7.42\n\n$0.176436\n\n$0.779981\n\n$0.740576\n\n$2,145.24\n\n$2.95\n\n$0.0933\n\n$1.00\n\n$2,022.24\n\n$0.04779581\n\n$0.00807387\n\n$1.28\n\n$0.560994\n\n$0.440003\n\n$0.00698026\n\n$87,688.00\n\n$0.00002207\n\n$2,021.73\n\n$0.00000044\n\n$0.524476\n\n$2,021.29\n\n$1.53\n\n$25.76\n\n$0.235668\n\n$110.46\n\n$1.083\n\n$1.001\n\n$45.08\n\n$0.425326\n\n$0.716161\n\n$0.944448\n\n$1.096\n\n$87,193.00\n\n$2,115.53\n\n$1.56\n\n$0.0370673\n\n$2,016.72\n\n$0.180297\n\n$2,018.32\n\n$0.00006601\n\n$1.45\n\n$0.01077108\n\n$0.00420261\n\n$1.00\n\n$86,868.00\n\n$0.00000173\n\n$3.14\n\n$0.999122\n\n$0.279781\n\n$131.99\n\n$0.999554\n\n$0.283819\n\n$1.004\n\n$2,002.41\n\n$1.31\n\n$4.00\n\n$0.723325\n\n$0.92043\n\n$0.03144228\n\n$2,022.13\n\n$0.104085\n\n$0.0032897\n\n$18.24\n\n$0.215015\n\n$24.29\n\n$0.405313\n\n$2,211.63\n\n$0.078273\n\n$0.287315\n\n$86,574.00\n\n$2,136.65\n\n$1.17\n\n$3.00\n\n$87,258.00\n\n$0.03568437\n\n$0.124161\n\n$0.00272595\n\n$0.616682\n\n$0.04043258\n\n$0.00372297\n\n$0.00583396\n\n$1.27\n\n$2,193.46\n\n$0.999743\n\n$0.52609\n\n$0.03418931\n\n$3,053.35\n\n$0.255812\n\n$2,022.97\n\n$0.750992\n\n$0.01281122\n\n$0.12124\n\n$1,754.63\n\n$0.243698\n\n$0.621639\n\n$0.241381\n\n$0.278231\n\n$2.21\n\nSen.

Now, He's Eyeing Another Senate Run\n\nBy Liz Napolitano\n\nMar 27, 2025Mar 27, 2025\n\n5 min read\n\nPro-XRP lawyer John Deaton may have lost his longshot bid to dethrone anti-crypto Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts last fall, but the former GOP candidate is already considering another Senate run.\n\nThis time he wants to tangle with the state's three-term Junior Sen. Ed Markey.\n\nThe political hopeful—a self-identified pro-abortion independent who only recently allied himself with the Republican Party— believes he can use his newfound “name recognition” to launch a successful campaign against Markey, a beloved career politician with deep roots in New England. The challenge, Deaton told Decrypt, will be convincing digital assets industry donors with deep pockets that a pro-crypto newcomer running on a Republican platform can pull off a major political upset in deep-blue Massachusetts.\n\n“It’s a race I can win, quite frankly,” Deaton said, speaking of a potential matchup against Markey, who plans to run for a fourth Senate term in 2026. But, “it depends if the crypto industry has written off Massachusetts.”\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has demanded that David Sacks, President Donald Trump's Crypto Czar, prove he isn't \"directly profiting off of the Trump Administration’s efforts to selectively pump the value of certain crypto assets.\"\nThe Massachusetts senator laid out her concerns about a conflict of interest in a 6-page letter she made public Friday morning, just hours ahead of a planned crypto summit at the White House.\nEarlier this week, Sacks said he sold all his crypto assets before beginning...\n\nAsked which donors he would like to court during his next potential political run, Deaton named Club for Growth and Fairshake. “Obviously, the big players,” he said.\n\nLast year, crypto industry players emerged as some of the largest corporate donors of the U.S. election cycle, wielding outsized influence on congressional races across the country.\n\nPro-crypto super PAC Fairshake’s $300 million blitz helped catapult more than four dozen digital asset industry allies to victory in congressional races across the country. Since then, the organization has added more than $100 million to its coffers for the 2026 Midterm elections.\n\nThe support of Fairshake, which did not bankroll Deaton in the 2024 election cycle, might help Deaton’s longshot bid to unseat Markey. But to court donors, the political hopeful will first have to prove that he can court the vote.\n\n“No one wants to donate to a lost cause,” Deaton said. “[Donors] are in the data.”\n\nAlthough midterm elections are more than a year away, Deaton is planning to launch an “all-issues” podcast on various kitchen-table topics within the next month—a move that could raise his profile among voters in Massachusetts. The former GOP candidate is also exploring a radio show opportunity with a Massachusetts-based station, he told Decrypt.\n\n“Politically speaking, [there’s this idea that] a Republican will never win so we’re not going to spend any money on them,” Deaton said. But, “if they all see that I can win and get behind it, then we could win.”\n\nAn XRP Lawyer Jumps into the Political Ring\n\nDeaton, a 57-year-old social media personality and XRP holder with nearly 400,000 followers on X, entered the political scene last year, shortly after moving to the Bay State with ambitions of running against Sen. Warren in a race that most critics deemed unwinnable.\n\n“She literally announced her plans to run on an anti-crypto army,” Deaton told Decrypt, adding that Warren had “gaslighted” the crypto community.\n\n“It offended me,” he said. “So I got in the race.”\n\nInitially known to many of his peers in the Massachusetts Republican Party as “that crypto weirdo,” Deaton nevertheless clinched the party’s nomination for the U.S. Senate last fall. He bootstrapped his campaign with a $1 million loan issued by himself, in addition to accepting donations from more than half a dozen crypto industry allies, including Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nThe funds didn’t make much of a difference. “I got beat,” Deaton recalled.\n\nBut Deaton says that challenging Warren was important partly to expose her views on issues where he feels she is out of touch, including digital assets.\n\n“No one was gonna beat her,” Deaton said. “But, I didn’t want her to have a free pass.\n\nAdvocating for Pro-Crypto Policies\n\nDeaton told Decrypt he intends to continue raising his voice on issues that matter within and beyond the crypto community, whether from the halls of Congress or on X.\n\nOn the crypto front, he cited the importance of U.S. regulators enacting more protections for retail investors in a way that supports innovation stateside.

strengthened its position among global Bitcoin holders with the purchase of 580 BTC valued at $50.64 million.\n\nThe acquisition brings the company's total Bitcoin holdings to 620 BTC, aligning with its long-term strategy of accumulating and perpetually holding BTC as a reserve asset.\n\nListed on Euronext Paris, The Blockchain Group has continued its Bitcoin accumulation strategy that began in November 2024, acquiring BTC to optimize its cash reserves.\n\nThe latest purchase, made through its 100% subsidiary The Blockchain Group Luxembourg SA, was financed using proceeds from a convertible bond issuance announced in early March.\n\nThe company’s accumulation strategy is driven by Bitcoin’s “unique attributes: unparalleled scarcity, security, and decentralization,” as noted on its website.\n\nAt the time of the announcement, the Bitcoin price was $87,311, bringing the total value of the group’s holdings to roughly $54 million.\n\nThe company's initial buys coincided with pivotal events like the U.S. presidential election and Bitcoin’s rise toward $100,000, giving the company a strong entry into the market.\n\nThe Blockchain Group, trading under the ALTBG ticker, saw its stock rise from $0.16 per share on November 5 to $0.51 on Wednesday, as per Google Finance data, marking a 220% increase since it began accumulating Bitcoin.\n\n🟠 The Blockchain Group confirms the acquisition of 580 BTC for ~€47.3 million, the holding of a total of 620 BTC, and a BTC Yield of 709.8% YTD.\n\n→ Confirmation of the acquisition of 580 BTC for ~€47.3 million at ~€81,550 per bitcoin\n\n→ Total group holdings of 620 BTC for… pic.twitter.com/8CCCax4Y39\n\n— The Blockchain Group (@_ALTBG) March 26, 2025\n\nTo track the performance of its Bitcoin treasury strategy, The Blockchain Group has introduced key performance indicators (KPIs) including BTC Yield, BTC Gain, and BTC € Gain.\n\nSuch metrics measure the percentage change in the ratio of total Bitcoin holdings to shares outstanding, offering transparency into the growth of the company’s Bitcoin assets.\n\nAs of the latest report, the company has achieved a BTC Yield of 709.8% year-to-date (YTD), pointing to the success of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy.\n\nThe French firm’s latest acquisition places it among the top 30 corporate Bitcoin holders globally, a list dominated by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds over 500,000 BTC.\n\nThe Bitcoin holdings of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, recently surpassed 500,000 Bitcoin following its latest stock sales, the company said on Monday. \nAfter acquiring 6,911 Bitcoin last week, the Tysons, Virginia-based firm said it now holds 506,137 Bitcoin valued at $44.2 billion, according to a press release.\nThe company said it purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $84,500 per coin, a slightly higher average price than the $83,000 that Strategy paid for 130 Bitcoin a week pri...\n\nThe Blockchain Group's action is in step with a broader trend of companies embracing BTC as part of their financial strategies.\n\nGameStop Corp., for instance, recently announced plans to raise $1.3 billion to purchase BTC, following a

    "full_content": "# Elizabeth Warren Calls Stablecoin Bill a Trump and Musk 'Grift'\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 27, 2025\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) took aim at a stablecoin-focused bill making its way through Congress, accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of using the legislation to further his own financial interests.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator shared the critique while linking a post about President Trump’s decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial, launching its own stablecoin USD1 on Ethereum and Binance’s BNB Chain.\n\nWarren voiced her concerns on social media, claiming President Trump is leveraging the project as a “grift” to “enrich” himself.\n\n“Congress should step up and fix the current stablecoin bill moving through the Senate that will make it easier for Trump—and Elon Musk—to take control of your money,” Warren wrote, criticizing the \"Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act\" (FIT21) bill.\n\nThe FIT21 bill seeks to create a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, with U.S. Rep. French Hill (R-AR) mentioning that in the “next few days,” legislators will roll out a revised bill.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is moving to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world\" through a series of initiatives, including the creation of a SEC Task Force dedicated to overseeing digital asset regulations.\n\nPresident Trump also called for “simple, common-sense rules for stablecoins and market structure” during a video call at the Blockworks crypto conference in New York last Thursday.\n\nThe stablecoin market currently holds over $238 billion in circulation, as per CoinGecko data, with Tether (USDT) making up a significant portion.\n\nTrump’s crypto czar, David Sacks, has previously promised to introduce legislation on stablecoins and market structures within the first 100 days of Trump’s second term.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator recently challenged Sacks to prove he’s not “directly profiting off of the Trump Administration’s efforts to selectively pump the value of certain crypto assets,” as he claimed he sold all his crypto assets before beginning in his role as crypto czar.\n\nElon Musk’s influence within the government, particularly through his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has only fueled Warren’s concerns.\n\nThe initiative, which Musk heads, aims to reduce government bureaucracy and eliminate excess regulations, but it has faced criticism for potentially giving Musk—and by extension, his business interests—a disproportionate amount of influence over U.S. financial policy.\n\nIn January, Warren

Warren Calls Stablecoin Bill a Trump and Musk 'Grift'\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) took aim at a stablecoin-focused bill making its way through Congress, accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of using the legislation to further his own financial interests.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator shared the critique while linking a post about President Trump’s decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial, launching its own stablecoin USD1 on Ethereum and Binance’s BNB Chain.\n\nWarren voiced her concerns on social media, claiming President Trump is leveraging the project as a “grift” to “enrich” himself.\n\n“Congress should step up and fix the current stablecoin bill moving through the Senate that will make it easier for Trump—and Elon Musk—to take control of your money,” Warren wrote, criticizing the \"Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act\" (FIT21) bill.\n\nThe FIT21 bill seeks to create a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, with U.S. Rep. French Hill (R-AR) mentioning that in the “next few days,” legislators will roll out a revised bill.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is moving to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world\" through a series of initiatives, including the creation of a SEC Task Force dedicated to overseeing digital asset regulations.\n\nPresident Trump also called for “simple, common-sense rules for stablecoins and market structure” during a video call at the Blockworks crypto conference in New York last Thursday.\n\nThe stablecoin market currently holds over $238 billion in circulation, as per CoinGecko data, with Tether (USDT) making up a significant portion.\n\nTrump’s crypto czar, David Sacks, has previously promised to introduce legislation on stablecoins and market structures within the first 100 days of Trump’s second term.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator recently challenged Sacks to prove he’s not “directly profiting off of the Trump Administration’s efforts to selectively pump the value of certain crypto assets,” as he claimed he sold all his crypto assets before beginning in his role as crypto czar.\n\nElon Musk’s influence within the government, particularly through his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has only fueled Warren’s concerns.\n\nThe initiative, which Musk heads, aims to reduce government bureaucracy and eliminate excess regulations, but it has faced criticism for potentially giving Musk—and by extension, his business interests—a disproportionate amount of influence over U.S. financial policy.\n\nIn January, Warren lambasted DOGE in a letter to the Dogecoin aficionado, accusing the department of being a potential “venue for corruption.”\n\nThe senator’s letter to Musk suggested a range of changes, including cracking down on tax loopholes for the wealthy and reforming government contracts to cut wasteful spending.\n\nEdited by Sebastian Sinclair\n\n",

a resolution to knock down a Biden-era rule previously pushed by the IRS that would have required decentralized finance platforms to collect and report taxpayer information.\n\nCritics argued the rule was \"fundamentally unworkable\" because DeFi platforms operate through automated code on blockchains without human intervention or visibility into user identities.\n\nEfforts to repeal and revise the IRS ruling emerged in January, with the U.S. House of Representatives signaling consideration by February.\n\nA week later, the Trump administration threw its weight behind those efforts, leading to a move from the Senate to overturn it on March 4.\n\nHowever, readings of the Congressional were restarted due to a \"blue slip\" issue where the House cited constitutional concerns over how budget matters are handled, arguing that the repeal should have started with the House.\n\nA parallel version of the resolution was later passed by the House earlier this month with a 292-132 bipartisan turnout.\n\nIt's now making its way to the White House, where President Donald Trump is expected to sign.\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that his office is looking to work closely with the IRS and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to \"rescind and amend\" related crypto tax rules that impacted how crypto and digital asset firms do business in the country.\n\nConcerns over the IRS broker rule point to its language about \"DeFi brokers\" as \"front-end service providers\" for digital asset transactions.\n\nIssues over how the rule unnecessarily extended these definitions were condemned by Commissioner Hester Pierce in February last year as something that would be \"harming\" market participants who have unwittingly found themselves “transformed into dealers.\"\n\nBy April of the same year, crypto lobbyists sued the then-Gensler-led SEC over broad language on and definitions of what constitutes operating as a \"dealer,\" with the DeFi Education Fund warning months later that the requirements would \"push this entire, burgeoning technology offshore.\"\n\nEdited by Sebastian

The confirmation process involves the committee's review, followed by a vote to advance the nomination to the full Senate for final approval.\n\nThe exact timing of the final confirmation vote will depend on the Senate's schedule and deliberations.​\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he has picked Paul Atkins, a former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to lead the regulatory agency as its next Chairman.\n\nSeen as a crypto-friendly successor to SEC Chair Gary Gensler—who has drawn the crypto industry’s ire for an aggressive string of enforcement actions under his leadership—Atkins served as an SEC commissioner for six years following his appointment by President George W.

As such, the dismissal of the claims as time-barred was \"consequently warranted,\" Judge Donato wrote.\n\nDfinity has been hit with a class-action suit in California alleging that the company sold its native Internet Computer Project (ICP) tokens as an unregistered security. \nThe complaint has been filed by California resident Daniel Ocampo “on behalf of all investors who purchased Internet Computer Project tokens on or after May 10, 2021.\" \nThe suit targets Olaf Carlson-Wee’s cryptocurrency hedge fund Polychain Capital, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and Dfinity's founder Dominic William...\n\nJudge Donato also found investors failed to prove their fraud claims.\n\nThe court rejected their core argument that Dfinity founder Dominic Williams must have known and \"necessarily had knowledge\" about token distribution issues simply because of his role.\n\nTuesday's ruling ends a contentious legal battle marked by controversy surrounding the plaintiffs' previous counsel.\n\nThe case experienced months of delays after Kyle Roche, a former partner at defunct crypto law firm Roche Freedman, was allegedly recorded boasting about using litigation to gather confidential info on crypto companies.\n\nFounders of the crypto law firm later went to court after fighting over $60 million worth of tokens issued by Ava Labs, according to a 2023 report from Reuters.\n\nRipple Labs has agreed to pay a $50 million fine to end the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s years-long investigation into the Ripple-linked firm, the company’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty said on Tuesday.\n“The SEC will keep $50M of the $125M fine,” he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, referring to the penalty Ripple Labs was ordered to pay by a New York court in August over unregistered XRP sales to institutional investors.\nAlderoty said that Ripple has meanwhile...\n\nThe plaintiffs, now represented by Selendy Gay PLLC after their previous counsel was replaced, had alleged Dfinity manipulated the digital asset market and artificially inflated ICP token prices following its May 2021 trading debut.\n\nDespite the dismissal, Judge Donato still granted investors a final opportunity to amend their complaint by April 8, warning that failure to meet the deadline would result in dismissal under federal rules on civil

Dismisses Dfinity Investor Suit For Being 'Time-Barred'\n\nA California federal judge has dismissed a class action lawsuit against Dfinity, the crypto firm behind Internet Computer (ICP), ruling that investors' claims the firm sold unregistered securities are barred by time limitations, having been sent one year and six months late.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Donato granted Dfinity's motion to dismiss Tuesday, finding the case \"time-barred\" under the Securities Exchange Act's three-year statute of repose.\n\nThe court sided with Dfinity's argument that it first offered ICP tokens to the public in February 2017, placing the August 2021 investor lawsuit outside the required timeframe.\n\nLaw360 first reported the news.\n\nThe plaintiffs, represented at the time by Freedman Normand Friedland LLP (formerly Roche Freedman) when it first filed, offered no response to the defendants' argument. As such, the dismissal of the claims as time-barred was \"consequently warranted,\" Judge Donato wrote.\n\nDfinity has been hit with a class-action suit in California alleging that the company sold its native Internet Computer Project (ICP) tokens as an unregistered security. \nThe complaint has been filed by California resident Daniel Ocampo “on behalf of all investors who purchased Internet Computer Project tokens on or after May 10, 2021.\" \nThe suit targets Olaf Carlson-Wee’s cryptocurrency hedge fund Polychain Capital, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and Dfinity's founder Dominic William...\n\nJudge Donato also found investors failed to prove their fraud claims.\n\nThe court rejected their core argument that Dfinity founder Dominic Williams must have known and \"necessarily had knowledge\" about token distribution issues simply because of his role.\n\nTuesday's ruling ends a contentious legal battle marked by controversy surrounding the plaintiffs' previous counsel.\n\nThe case experienced months of delays after Kyle Roche, a former partner at defunct crypto law firm Roche Freedman, was allegedly recorded boasting about using litigation to gather confidential info on crypto companies.\n\nFounders of the crypto law firm later went to court after fighting over $60 million worth of tokens issued by Ava Labs, according to a 2023 report from Reuters.\n\nRipple Labs has agreed to pay a $50 million fine to end the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s years-long investigation into the Ripple-linked firm, the company’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty said on Tuesday.\n“The SEC will keep $50M of the $125M fine,” he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, referring to the penalty Ripple Labs was ordered to pay by a New York court in August over unregistered XRP sales to institutional investors.\nAlderoty said that Ripple has meanwhile...\n\nThe plaintiffs, now represented by Selendy Gay PLLC after their previous counsel was replaced, had alleged Dfinity manipulated the digital asset market and artificially inflated ICP token prices following its May 2021 trading debut.\n\nDespite the dismissal, Judge Donato still granted investors a final opportunity to amend their complaint by April 8, warning that failure to meet the deadline would result in dismissal under federal rules on civil procedure.\n\nRepresentatives for Selendy Gay PLLC, Freedman Normand Friedland (formerly Roche Freedman), and Dfinity Foundation did not immediately respond to Decrypt's requests for comment.\n\nEdited by Sebastian Sinclair\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) took aim at a stablecoin-focused bill making its way through Congress, accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of using the legislation to further his own financial interests.\nThe Massachusetts senator shared the critique while linking a post about President Trump’s decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial, launching its own stablecoin USD1 on Ethereum and Binance’s BNB Chain.\nWarren voiced her concerns on social media, claiming Presi...\n\nThe Senate voted 70-28 on Wednesday in support of a resolution to knock down a Biden-era rule previously pushed by the IRS that would have required decentralized finance platforms to collect and report taxpayer information.\nCritics argued the rule was \"fundamentally unworkable\" because DeFi platforms operate through automated code on blockchains without human intervention or visibility into user identities.\nEfforts to repeal and revise the IRS ruling emerged in January, with the U.S. House of Re...\n\nPaul Atkins, the Trump administration’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, said regulation of crypto will be a top priority if confirmed as chairman.\nIn prepared remarks ahead of a confirmation hearing Thursday morning before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Atkins took aim at “ambiguous and non-existent” digital asset regulation that has hindered market growth.\n“Since 2017, as I have led industry efforts to develop best practices for the digital ass...\n\n",
