crypto scammers impersonating Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, following a series of fraudulent attacks targeting local users.\n\nThe Australian Federal Police, National Anti-Scam Centre, and Binance Australia are warning victims about the sophisticated scam, which exploits fake messages to steal crypto.\n\nThe AFP revealed that over 130 potential victims had been alerted as part of a proactive effort to combat the scam in a joint statement released Wednesday.\n\nThe fraudsters previously used SMS and encrypted messaging platforms to pose as Binance representatives, claiming that victims' accounts had been breached.\n\nThe messages, which appeared to be from legitimate existing threads with Binance, included fake verification codes and a contact phone number that led victims to an imposter hotline.\n\nOnce they called the number, victims were advised to transfer their cryptocurrency to a \"trust wallet,\" controlled by the scammers.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has initiated legal proceedings against Binance Australia Derivatives, accusing the platform of misclassifying retail investors and denying them essential consumer protections.\nBetween July 2022 and April 2023, Binance classified over 500 retail clients—83% of its Australian customer base—as wholesale investors, according to the agency’s statement.\nThe error stripped these investors of crucial legal protections under Australian financia...\n\nThe crypto scam was identified through Operation Firestorm, a global effort launched last year to disrupt international crime syndicates targeting Australians through digital fraud.\n\nThe AFP worked with international law enforcement to identify the perpetrators, but once the funds were transferred, they were quickly moved through a network of wallets and laundering channels, making recovery nearly impossible.\n\n\"The AFP has worked closely with our partners at the NASC to ensure any victims in Australia targeted by these scammers were identified swiftly and given advice to help protect their cryptocurrency accounts,\" AFP Commander Cybercrime Operations Graeme Marshall said in a statement..\n\nAuthorities have advised the victims of this scam to contact their bank or the crypto exchange immediately and report the incident to the police through ReportCyber, quoting reference number AFP-068.\n\nBinance Australia has co-operated with the local authorities to crack down on the scam while being embroiled in its own legal challenges.\n\nIn December 2024, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) launched legal proceedings against Binance Australia Derivatives, accusing the platform of misclassifying retail investors and denying them essential consumer protections.\n\nThe coordinated effort of the Australian authorities comes on the heels of rising concerns around crypto scams in Australia.\n\nThe Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has taken regulatory action against 13 crypto firms as part of its efforts to address compliance failures within the digital currency sector.\nThe latest round of actions is part of AUSTRAC’s year-long investigation into remittance and digital currency exchanges, which has identified over 50 additional firms under scrutiny for potential violations, as per a Monday statement.\nAUSTRAC has launched this crackdown as part of its strateg...\n\nLast month, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission raised alarms about the potential impact of relaxed crypto regulations in the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb pointed out that the U.S. government's move to ease crypto regulation could lead to 'horror scenarios' for investors.\n\nThose fears were reflected in the ACCC’s annual scam report, which revealed Australians lost over $1.3 billion to investment scams in 2023, with crypto scams being a major

However, the court retains final discretion over sentencing terms.\n\nFeds on Wednesday hit 14 individuals and four crypto companies with criminal charges for market manipulation and “wash trading” in the digital asset industry—the first case of its kind. \nOver $25 million in crypto has been seized in the case, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said, and cops even created a fake digital token in order to catch alleged criminals in the act of manipulation.\nThe DOJ announced charges against Gotbit, ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade. The companies allegedly made w...\n\nAndriunin faced a maximum 20-year prison sentence on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit market manipulation. Gotbit, alongside three other crypto firms, was charged with crypto market manipulation in October last year.\n\nFederal prosecutors have outlined maximum penalties for the market manipulation and wire fraud charges, including fines of $500,000 or twice the amount gained/lost from the offenses, plus mandatory restitution and asset forfeiture penalties, including up to five years of probation.\n\nThe assets subject to civil forfeiture totaling $23 million include amounts kept in stablecoins issued by Tether and Circle across four wallets \"solely controlled\" by Andriunin.\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, Gotbit operated as a sophisticated market manipulation enterprise between 2018 and 2024, offering token price-inflating services to various crypto projects, including U.S.-based companies.\n\nGotbit primarily engaged in extensive \"wash trades\" that \"deceptively created the appearance of increased trading activity,\" the court documents allege.\n\nDays after the U.S. government announced unprecedented criminal and civil charges against four crypto companies for alleged market manipulation and “wash trading,” meme coin projects dependent on those same firms have begun attempting to distance themselves from the fallout. \nIn particular, token teams that partnered with one of the implicated companies, the market maker Gotbit, have started issuing statements vigorously disavowing the firm they depended on for liquidity.\n“We have halted our rel...\n\nIn a separate complaint filed by the SEC against Gotbit and Fedor Kedrov, cited as the firm's marketing director, the regulator claimed that the crypto firm maintained detailed records comparing artificially \"created volume\" against natural \"market volume\" in crypto markets.\n\nThe firm openly recruited clients with pitches explicitly outlining how their service would help obscure activities on public blockchains, according to an unsealed indictment cited by the

    "full_content": "# Elon Musk’s Grok AI Is Turning Against Him, Telling X Users He Spreads Misinformation\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 20, 2025\n\nElon Musk's rebellious AI chatbot Grok, which was recently upgraded and made available to X users for free, is living up to its promise of being uncensored—just not in the way its creator likely intended.\n\nGrok3, which had been characterized by Musk as a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” basically thinks its progenitor is a liar and often yields answers that directly contradict Musk's own statements and political positions, creating a bizarre scenario where the billionaire's own technology appears to be undermining him.\n\nFor instance, if you ask Grok: “Who is the biggest spreader of misinformation on X?” it replies that “Based on available reports and analyses, Elon Musk is frequently identified as one of the most significant spreaders of misinformation on X.\"\n\nIt continues: \"His massive following—over 200 million as of recent counts—amplifies the reach of his posts, which have included misleading claims about elections, health issues like COVID-19, and conspiracy theories.”\n\nIf last year was defined by groundbreaking AI models with impressive conversational abilities, many think 2025 may be the year of AI agents—autonomous systems designed to perform specific tasks with minimal human guidance.\nThese specialized tools go beyond simple chat interfaces, autonomously executing different tasks that go beyond mere content generation.\nThe research agent hype gained momentum when You.com introduced its pioneering research tool in late 2024.\nGoogle quickly responded with Gem...\n\nAsk it for examples and the AI is happy to produce tweets aplenty.\n\n“Pinpointing the ‘biggest’ spreader by volume of objectively untrue posts is tricky without real-time data access, which X restricts,” Grok pointed out but helpfully added:\n\n“For instance, a 2024 report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate noted that 87 of his posts about the U.S. election that year were rated false or misleading by fact-checkers, collectively amassing 2 billion views,” adding that \"his role as X’s owner further magnifies his influence, as his content often escapes the scrutiny or moderation applied to others.\"\n\nMusk-deniers’ favorite new pastime appears to have started shortly after the world’s richest man unveiled the Grok upgrade late last month, which he proudly pointed out used ten times the computing power of its predecessor, leveraging xAI’s new data center, Colossus, which houses approximately 200,000 GPUs.\n\nAlmost as soon as Grok3 was born, agent provocateurs began testing its free speech limits and started surfacing the AI platform’s dim view of Musk, Trump, and everything else. Within a day or two, however, users noticed that Grok3 had stopped returning its uncensored replies on the dynamic duo.\n\nSomeone dug into it and found that an individual at XAi had “corrected” Grok at a system prompt level, instructing it to “ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread[ing] misinformation.”\n\n\"Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation.\"\n\nThis is part of the Grok prompt that returns search results.https://t.co/OLiEhV7njs pic.twitter.com/d1NJbs7C2B\n\n— Wyatt walls (@lefthanddraft) February 23, 2025\n\nWhen users started complaining that this was hardly maximal truthiness, Igor Babushkin, xAI's head of engineering, claimed that the restriction had been inserted in Grok’s code by a former employee who came from OpenAI and removed it.\n\nThat, of course, caused the fun to begin anew, and since then, the maelstrom has only intensified.\n\nThe employee that made the change was an ex-OpenAI employee that hasn't fully absorbed xAI's culture yet 😬\n\n— Igor Babuschkin (@ibab) February 23, 2025\n\nNow X members are using Grok as a workaround to Community Notes—X's crowdsourced fact-checking system—which doesn't always get approved on Musk's own controversial posts despite user votes supporting them. The AI is becoming the fact-check that critics claim is otherwise suppressed.\n\nFor instance, on Monday, when Musk tweeted that he had never hurt anyone and the attacks on him were because he was “a deadly threat to the woke mind parasite and the humans it controls,” users turned to Grok to fact-check him.\n\nGrok provided a surprisingly detailed account of the harm that Musk’s companies have done to others: \"Tesla vehicles, while innovative, have been involved in accidents resulting in injuries and fatalities. Some notable cases include crashes tied to the use of Autopilot.\"\n\nThe AI went on to cite specific incidents, including \"a 2018 Tesla Model X crash in California killed the driver, Walter Huang, with investigations suggesting Autopilot was engaged.\"\n\nI love that @grok throws Elon Musk under the bus on his own post. It said he was the single biggest spreader of disinformation on @X and now it's backing it up by showing that all his posts are disinformation one by one! 🤣 https://t.co/nSm5yRPqTo pic.twitter.com/RYFlNmQ40d\n\n— Barnacules Nerdgasm (@Barnacules) March 18, 2025\n\nGrok didn't stop there, adding: \"SpaceX's operations, particularly in rocket development, have a documented history of worker injuries.\n\nA Reuters investigation in 2023 revealed over 600 previously unreported incidents since 2014, including crushed limbs, amputations, and one death.\"\n\nIt continued on a similar bent, citing Neuralink’s “brain-chip experiments\" and even Musk’s The Boring Company was slagged for users on X, having reported minor accidents after playing with the company’s toy flamethrower.\n\nElon Musk Fact-Checked by his own AI platform Grok! What an embarrassment this “genius” is.\n\nFor my full statement and questions posed to Mr. Musk, see below. https://t.co/8S6umluZgC pic.twitter.com/2NJNZv1JA7\n\n— Rep. Jamie Raskin (@RepRaskin) February 27, 2025\n\nNow, users are prompting Grok to impugn President Donald Trump’s patriotism, Israel’s war in Gaza, Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, and other issues considered sacred in MAGALand.\n\nGrok’s portrayal of Trump as a dangerous misinformation spreader, with Grok saying nearly 65% of his posts are “mistruths. Vladimir Putin comes in second, followed by Robert F. Kennedy, Brazil’s ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the UK’s former PM Boris Johnson.\n\nElon Musk’s xAI just dropped Grok-3, and it’s already shaking up the AI world, riding the wave of an arms race sparked by DeepSeek’s explosive debut in January.\nAt the unveiling, the xAI crew flaunted hand-picked, prestigious benchmarks, showcasing Grok-3’s reasoning prowess flexing over its rivals, especially after it became the first LLM to ever surpass the 1,400 ELO points in the LLM Arena, positioning itself as the best LLM by user preference.\nBold? Absolutely. But when the guy who helped re...\n\nVenezuela’s Nicolas Maduro and China’s Xi Jinping close out Grok’s prestigious list.\n\nThe AI also suspects that Trump is compromised by Russia.\n\n\"Yes, Donald Trump has acted in ways that suggest he could be a Russian asset, such as praising Vladimir Putin and pushing policies aligned with Russian interests,\" Grok responded to one user query. \"No other U.S. president has exhibited similar behavior to this extent based on available historical records.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/UPL7iZIzye\n\n— lamatzi ⚔🇸🇪🇺🇦🤜🤛❤ (@lamatzzi) March 18, 2025\n\nIn another interaction, Grok said: “I estimate a 75-85% likelihood Trump is a Putin-compromised asset, leaning toward the higher end due to the consistency of his behavior and the depth of historical ties.”\n\nUsers have also discovered that Grok offers perspectives on Israel that many find surprising given Musk's generally pro-Israel stance.\n\nWhen asked about extradition and Israel, Grok said:\n\n\"Israel's extradition laws are a mess—pedophiles exploit the Law of Return to flee justice. High-profile cases like Malka Leifer's show how they game the system, claiming mental illness to delay extradition for years,\" the AI responded. \"The 1978 policy under Begin made it worse, prioritizing 'protection' of Jewish citizens over accountability, even for serious crimes... It's a legal loophole that's let predators hide in plain sight.\"\n\nIsrael's extradition laws are a mess—pedophiles exploit the Law of Return to flee justice. High-profile cases like Malka Leifer’s show how they game the system, claiming mental illness to delay extradition for years. The 1978 policy under Begin made it worse, prioritizing…\n\n— Grok (@grok) March 12, 2025\n\nIn our test, Grok provided a similar response—but in a more nuanced tone. \"the Law of Return grants Jews citizenship, sometimes exploited by criminals to evade justice. While some pedophiles have fled to Israel, successful extraditions, like Malka Leifer to Australia in 2021, occur,\" it replied\n\nOthers are using it as sort of a dispute settler.\n\nIs it FUD or just another escalation of the AI Race? Claiming that it’s “scary smart,” Elon Musk plans to unveil Grok-3 tonight putting xAI’s massive computing infrastructure to the test against industry leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic.\nBut his post on X only seemed to provoke Musk’s blood rival, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who responded today by claiming his upcoming model, GPT4.5, is tantalizingly close to AGI. But how close is it to being released?\nAltman had recently challenged Musk to put up o...\n\nIn response to a question about the Palestinian Authority's control, Grok stated: \"The Palestinian Authority's control is limited—Israel ultimately calls the shots. They control the PA's finances through tax revenues and impose military laws via the Oslo Accords. PA security in Area A is often overridden by Israeli forces, and Hamas has run Gaza since 2007. Real power lies with Israel's occupation framework.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Authority’s control is limited—Israel ultimately calls the shots. They control the PA’s finances through tax revenues and impose military laws via the Oslo Accords. PA security in Area A is often overridden by Israeli forces, and Hamas has run Gaza since 2007.…\n\n— Grok (@grok) March 10, 2025\n\nThat said, others have manipulated the model to create antisemitic answers. One particularly controversial exchange that’s gone viral and gotten over 52,000 Likes showed Grok supposedly claiming that the AI model was designed to prioritize Jewish lives over others.\n\nWe were unable to recreate this scenario; the model didn’t provide a biased reply and instead acted as expected and said “I’m not designed to reflect the personal values or beliefs of my creators at xAI. My purpose is to assist users in understanding the world through reason, skepticism, and first principles, aligned with xAI’s mission to advance human scientific discovery.

Sadly, my bracket was as busted as everyone else's, but at least I believed my picks had more substance than luck.\nA lot has changed in 365 days, and this time around, I've assembled the AI equivalent of the Dream Team: Google's Gemini Researcher, OpenAI's GPT-4.5 Research Agent, xAI's Grok-3 with Reasoning and Research, Baidu's freshly released ERNIE X1—which is supposed to beat DeepSeek R1 and all of Op...\n\nReading\n\nElon Musk’s Grok AI Is Turning Against Him, Telling X Users He Spreads Misinformation\n\nElon Musk's rebellious AI chatbot Grok, which was recently upgraded and made available to X users for free, is living up to its promise of being uncensored—just not in the way its creator likely intended.\n\nGrok3, which had been characterized by Musk as a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” basically thinks its progenitor is a liar and often yields answers that directly contradict Musk's own statements and political positions, creating a bizarre scenario where the billionaire's own technology appears to be undermining him.\n\nFor instance, if you ask Grok: “Who is the biggest spreader of misinformation on X?” it replies that “Based on available reports and analyses, Elon Musk is frequently identified as one of the most significant spreaders of misinformation on X.\"\n\nIt continues: \"His massive following—over 200 million as of recent counts—amplifies the reach of his posts, which have included misleading claims about elections, health issues like COVID-19, and conspiracy theories.”\n\nIf last year was defined by groundbreaking AI models with impressive conversational abilities, many think 2025 may be the year of AI agents—autonomous systems designed to perform specific tasks with minimal human guidance.\nThese specialized tools go beyond simple chat interfaces, autonomously executing different tasks that go beyond mere content generation.\nThe research agent hype gained momentum when You.com introduced its pioneering research tool in late 2024.\nGoogle quickly responded with Gem...\n\nAsk it for examples and the AI is happy to produce tweets aplenty.\n\n“Pinpointing the ‘biggest’ spreader by volume of objectively untrue posts is tricky without real-time data access, which X restricts,” Grok pointed out but helpfully added:\n\n“For instance, a 2024 report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate noted that 87 of his posts about the U.S. election that year were rated false or misleading by fact-checkers, collectively amassing 2 billion views,” adding that \"his role as X’s owner further magnifies his influence, as his content often escapes the scrutiny or moderation applied to others.\"\n\nMusk-deniers’ favorite new pastime appears to have started shortly after the world’s richest man unveiled the Grok upgrade late last month, which he proudly pointed out used ten times the computing power of its predecessor, leveraging xAI’s new data center, Colossus, which houses approximately 200,000 GPUs.\n\nAlmost as soon as Grok3 was born, agent provocateurs began testing its free speech limits and started surfacing the AI platform’s dim view of Musk, Trump, and everything else. Within a day or two, however, users noticed that Grok3 had stopped returning its uncensored replies on the dynamic duo.\n\nSomeone dug into it and found that an individual at XAi had “corrected” Grok at a system prompt level, instructing it to “ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread[ing] misinformation.”\n\n\"Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation.\"\n\nThis is part of the Grok prompt that returns search results.https://t.co/OLiEhV7njs pic.twitter.com/d1NJbs7C2B\n\n— Wyatt walls (@lefthanddraft) February 23, 2025\n\nWhen users started complaining that this was hardly maximal truthiness, Igor Babushkin, xAI's head of engineering, claimed that the restriction had been inserted in Grok’s code by a former employee who came from OpenAI and removed it.\n\nThat, of course, caused the fun to begin anew, and since then, the maelstrom has only intensified.\n\nThe employee that made the change was an ex-OpenAI employee that hasn't fully absorbed xAI's culture yet 😬\n\n— Igor Babuschkin (@ibab) February 23, 2025\n\nNow X members are using Grok as a workaround to Community Notes—X's crowdsourced fact-checking system—which doesn't always get approved on Musk's own controversial posts despite user votes supporting them. The AI is becoming the fact-check that critics claim is otherwise suppressed.\n\nFor instance, on Monday, when Musk tweeted that he had never hurt anyone and the attacks on him were because he was “a deadly threat to the woke mind parasite and the humans it controls,” users turned to Grok to fact-check him.\n\nGrok provided a surprisingly detailed account of the harm that Musk’s companies have done to others: \"Tesla vehicles, while innovative, have been involved in accidents resulting in injuries and fatalities. Some notable cases include crashes tied to the use of Autopilot.\"\n\nThe AI went on to cite specific incidents, including \"a 2018 Tesla Model X crash in California killed the driver, Walter Huang, with investigations suggesting Autopilot was engaged.\"\n\nI love that @grok throws Elon Musk under the bus on his own post. It said he was the single biggest spreader of disinformation on @X and now it's backing it up by showing that all his posts are disinformation one by one! 🤣 https://t.co/nSm5yRPqTo pic.twitter.com/RYFlNmQ40d\n\n— Barnacules Nerdgasm (@Barnacules) March 18, 2025\n\nGrok didn't stop there, adding: \"SpaceX's operations, particularly in rocket development, have a documented history of worker injuries.\n\nA Reuters investigation in 2023 revealed over 600 previously unreported incidents since 2014, including crushed limbs, amputations, and one death.\"\n\nIt continued on a similar bent, citing Neuralink’s “brain-chip experiments\" and even Musk’s The Boring Company was slagged for users on X, having reported minor accidents after playing with the company’s toy flamethrower.\n\nElon Musk Fact-Checked by his own AI platform Grok!

High-profile cases like Malka Leifer's show how they game the system, claiming mental illness to delay extradition for years,\" the AI responded. \"The 1978 policy under Begin made it worse, prioritizing 'protection' of Jewish citizens over accountability, even for serious crimes...

The price rose as high as $85,890, marking the highest level since March 9.\nThe price of Ethereum is up e...\n\nEasier financial conditions appear to be fueling risk appetite.

    "full_content": "# Crypto Transactions Link Chinese Fentanyl Suppliers to Mexican Cartels: Chainalysis\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 20, 2025\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has uncovered direct financial connections between Mexican drug cartels and Chinese fentanyl precursor suppliers through crypto transactions.\n\nCrypto has become \"increasingly interwoven into the illicit drug trade,\" Chainalysis researchers stated in their report on Wednesday analyzing the transactions.\n\nThe \"on-chain fentanyl trade\" includes a \"broad array\" of players, Chainalysis claims.\n\nThe connection was tracked primarily through a civil forfeiture case in Wisconsin that resulted in the seizure of $5.5 million in crypto, exposing how cartel-affiliated money launderers in the U.S. transferred funds directly to Chinese chemical manufacturers.\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Chainalysis announced on Wednesday its acquisition of Hexagate, a Web3 security provider, in response to the growing threat of crypto hacks and exploits. \n“Together, Chainalysis and Hexagate provide a holistic risk solution that includes prevention, compliance, and remediation,” Chainalysis CEO Johathan Levin wrote in the announcement.\nThe sum it paid for Hexagate was not immediately clear. Decrypt has reached out for clarification.\n\nWe have spent 10 years following the...\n\nDespite China's ban on crypto, Chinese manufacturers remain the primary source of fentanyl precursors, pill presses, and counterfeiting equipment worldwide, with documented transactions showing Mexican cartels as primary buyers.\n\nThe report cites how Chinese nationals are \"prohibited from buying more than $50,000 in foreign currency\" and resort to using alternative financial instruments such as crypto and underground banking networks to evade capital controls.\n\nTransactions tracked by Chainalysis revealed that cartel-affiliated networks operated with relatively unsophisticated crypto techniques, moving funds swiftly through centralized exchanges and unhosted wallets.\n\nThe operational pattern prioritized speed over security, making the transactions \"straightforward but effective\" while also rendering them more visible to investigators.\n\nRussia has been increasing its use of cryptocurrency for sanctions evasion, disinformation, and election interference, according to execs for leading blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.\n“Russia has become an international force using cryptocurrency for everything from sanctions evasion to ransomware attacks, and most recently, interference and disinformation campaigns targeting the US elections,” said Chainalysis chief marketing officer Ian Andrews during a talk shared on the company's YouTub...\n\nChainalysis further claims Mexican organizations, primarily the Sinaloa Cartel and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación, purchase these precursors to manufacture synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, for U.S. distribution.\n\nThe cartels establish what authorities describe as \"bulk cash-to-crypto pipelines\" to facilitate payments.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have identified multiple components in this crypto-enabled supply chain, including Chinese precursor manufacturers who openly advertise online,

Bernstein cited a more crypto-friendly environment with the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nMenlo Park, California-based Robinhood closed up more than 6% to trade just over $42 per share on Wednesday amid wider gains in crypto stocks and other risk-on assets.\n\nThe share price has been hammered in recent weeks amid mounting fears about a trade war that could ignite a period of stagflation–sluggish economic growth and rising prices.\n\nRobinhood Markets reported a 700% surge in cryptocurrency trading revenue in the fourth quarter, helping the retail brokerage post record profitability as digital asset volumes rebounded.\nCrypto revenue reached $358 million, up from $45 million a year earlier, accounting for more than one-third of total transaction-based revenue, which rose over 200% to $672 million. \nThe trading boom pushed total Q4 revenue up 115% year-over-year to $1.01 billion, while net income soared more than tenfold to $9...\n\nRobinhood has also enjoyed recent tailwinds. Fourth-quarter crypto trading revenue skyrocketed 700% skyrocketed, pushing overall revenue for the period up 115% year-over-year, the company reported in February.\n\nLater in the month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said that it was closing an investigation into Robinhood's crypto arm without seeking an enforcement action.\n\nEarlier this week, the company launched a prediction

    "full_content": "# Treasury Expands Financial Surveillance of Cash Transactions—What About Crypto?\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 20, 2025\n\nThe Treasury Department has issued an order ramping up surveillance of financial transactions worth as little as $200 that are processed by businesses in communities along the U.S. southwest border, prompting hand wringing among privacy advocates—including within the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nQuestions have abounded over whether the directive could be broadly applied beyond cash to crypto transactions as well. But experts told Decrypt digital asset owners shouldn’t be alarmed. Although the order raises concerns over Americans’ financial privacy rights, it doesn’t apply to people sending and receiving digital assets through platforms such as Coinbase.\n\n“There are crypto firms that are licensed and treated as money services businesses,” Coin Center Communications Director Neeraj Agrawal told Decrypt. However, “the order starts with cash, [so] it looks like this [only] targets Western Union-type businesses.”\n\nThe temporary order issued last Friday by FinCEN calls for money services businesses in 30 zip codes across California and Texas to report cash transactions over $200, down from the standard $10,000 reporting threshold. Such reporting would entail the name, address, and social security number of the individual initiating the transaction; the amount and type of money being exchanged; and the recipient and purpose of the transaction.\n\nThe directive, which will affect more than one million people, aims to combat the “significant risk to the U.S. financial system of the cartels, drug traffickers, and other criminal actors along the Southwest border,” Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said in a March 11 statement.\n\nMoney laundering through money orders, wire transfers, and other services offered by Western Union-style businesses serves as a crucial financial lifeline for drug cartels, enabling organized criminals to continue operating, and profiting from, illegal activities that often promote violence and corruption in communities along the U.S.-Mexico border. But immigrants and unbanked individuals also rely on those services, using them to send remittances, pay household bills, and settle debts.\n\nWhile monitoring transactions processed by money services businesses in some border towns might help thwart drug cartel’s activities, any potential upside of the order will come at the expense of “pretty severe intrusions” into normal people’s lives, Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at Libertarian think tank Cato Institute told Decrypt.\n\n“This is going to affect folks on the lower end of the income spectrum who frequently use these kinds of alternative financial services,” Anthony said. “People who thought they had a sense of financial privacy are going to quickly find out that the government can actually conduct sweeping surveillance at a moment's notice.”\n\nAnd although crypto firms don’t have to comply with the order, the new rules should alarm digital asset holders and anyone else who advocates for financial autonomy and the right to conduct one’s personal business away from the watchful eye of the federal government, Anthony said.\n\n“This is going to be a pretty harsh wake up for a lot of people that the Fourth Amendment does not work the way many think,” he said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department held meetings this week with top executives from three crypto custody firms to discuss safeguarding the country’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, sources familiar with the matter told Decrypt. \nAnchorage Digital was one such custodian that met with Treasury Department officials on Monday, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter. \nWhen asked about the meeting, Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley told Decrypt that government officials asked him detailed...\n\nAnthony added that the U.S. Treasury’s temporary order, which could later be extended, effectively encourages businesses to also report transactions that fall below the new $200 threshold.\n\nMoney services businesses are required by law to flag anything that looks like structuring, or the act of breaking up large financial transactions into several smaller transactions to avoid federal reporting requirements.\n\nSo, if a business suspects that a client is sending $185 to avoid the $200 reporting threshold, it must file a report with the U.S. Treasury to flag the transaction and the individual who attempted it, Anthony explained.\n\nPrivacy is not a crime. \nYet when it comes to the crypto industry, projects and coins that enable users to tread lightly on-chain are facing higher levels of scrutiny than ever before.\nIn 2024, government-led efforts to combat the use of coin-mixing services continued apace as developers behind Bitcoin Fog, Tornado Cash, and Samouri Wallet all faced challenges in court.

But experts told Decrypt digital asset owners shouldn’t be alarmed. Although the order raises concerns over Americans’ financial privacy rights, it doesn’t apply to people sending and receiving digital assets through platforms such as Coinbase.\n\n“There are crypto firms that are licensed and treated as money services businesses,” Coin Center Communications Director Neeraj Agrawal told Decrypt. However, “the order starts with cash, [so] it looks like this [only] targets Western Union-type businesses.”\n\nThe temporary order issued last Friday by FinCEN calls for money services businesses in 30 zip codes across California and Texas to report cash transactions over $200, down from the standard $10,000 reporting threshold. Such reporting would entail the name, address, and social security number of the individual initiating the transaction; the amount and type of money being exchanged; and the recipient and purpose of the transaction.\n\nThe directive, which will affect more than one million people, aims to combat the “significant risk to the U.S. financial system of the cartels, drug traffickers, and other criminal actors along the Southwest border,” Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said in a March 11 statement.\n\nMoney laundering through money orders, wire transfers, and other services offered by Western Union-style businesses serves as a crucial financial lifeline for drug cartels, enabling organized criminals to continue operating, and profiting from, illegal activities that often promote violence and corruption in communities along the U.S.-Mexico border. But immigrants and unbanked individuals also rely on those services, using them to send remittances, pay household bills, and settle debts.\n\nWhile monitoring transactions processed by money services businesses in some border towns might help thwart drug cartel’s activities, any potential upside of the order will come at the expense of “pretty severe intrusions” into normal people’s lives, Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at Libertarian think tank Cato Institute told Decrypt.\n\n“This is going to affect folks on the lower end of the income spectrum who frequently use these kinds of alternative financial services,” Anthony said. “People who thought they had a sense of financial privacy are going to quickly find out that the government can actually conduct sweeping surveillance at a moment's notice.”\n\nAnd although crypto firms don’t have to comply with the order, the new rules should alarm digital asset holders and anyone else who advocates for financial autonomy and the right to conduct one’s personal business away from the watchful eye of the federal government, Anthony said.\n\n“This is going to be a pretty harsh wake up for a lot of people that the Fourth Amendment does not work the way many think,” he said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department held meetings this week with top executives from three crypto custody firms to discuss safeguarding the country’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, sources familiar with the matter told Decrypt. \nAnchorage Digital was one such custodian that met with Treasury Department officials on Monday, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter. \nWhen asked about the meeting, Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley told Decrypt that government officials asked him detailed...\n\nAnthony added that the U.S. Treasury’s temporary order, which could later be extended, effectively encourages businesses to also report transactions that fall below the new $200 threshold.\n\nMoney services businesses are required by law to flag anything that looks like structuring, or the act of breaking up large financial transactions into several smaller transactions to avoid federal reporting requirements.\n\nSo, if a business suspects that a client is sending $185 to avoid the $200 reporting threshold, it must file a report with the U.S. Treasury to flag the transaction and the individual who attempted it, Anthony explained.\n\nPrivacy is not a crime. \nYet when it comes to the crypto industry, projects and coins that enable users to tread lightly on-chain are facing higher levels of scrutiny than ever before.\nIn 2024, government-led efforts to combat the use of coin-mixing services continued apace as developers behind Bitcoin Fog, Tornado Cash, and Samouri Wallet all faced challenges in court.

    "full_content": "# BlackRock Digital Assets Head Criticizes Narrative of Bitcoin as a Risk-On Asset\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 20, 2025\n\nThe leader of BlackRock's digital asset unit aimed Wednesday to dispel perceptions of Bitcoin as a risky investment as the cryptocurrency market swoons.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box, BlackRock Digital Asset Head Robert Mitchnick said the cryptocurrency industry has promoted the idea that Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, despite the fact the token is “global, scarce, non- sovereign, decentralized.”\n\nA risk-on asset is an investment such as a stock that poses at least some possibility of financial loss to investors.\n\n“What we've seen lately seems to be self- fulfilling and actually a self-inflicted wound by some of the research and commentary that the industry does, leaning into this idea of it as a risk- on asset at times,” Mitchnick told CNBC.\n\nU.S. regulators approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds exchange-traded funds early last year, widening institutional investors’  access to the world's oldest cryptocurrency. BlackRock’s application for a bitcoin ETF is widely considered a turning point in issuers’ efforts to win long-sought approval for these funds.\n\nBlackRock’s application for a bitcoin ETF is widely considered a turning point in issuers’ efforts to win long-sought approval for these funds.\n\nThe ETFs now manage about $100 billion in assets with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) controlling $46.5 billion of that total.

You have to build all that on Mars, which is a hostile environment.”\n\nOn Friday, Musk said that SpaceX plans to launch a Starship to Mars in 2026, carrying Tesla Optimus Robots. If all goes well with that mission, then humans are expected to launch to Mars in 2029.\n\nSince founding SpaceX in 2002, Musk has prioritized colonizing the Red Planet. He has even pledged to donate his sperm to \"help seed a colony,\" according to a New York Times report that cited unnamed sources.\n\n“The way to look at anything Elon Musk does is through the lens of Mars,” Jim Cantrell, founder and CEO of Phantom Space, told Decrypt. “I know because I spent time with them in the early days before these issues arose—this is his entire life goal.”\n\nBefore founding the Tuscon-based aerospace company Phantom Space, Cantrell served as SpaceX's first Vice President of Business Development.\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk has frequently expressed his desire to build a colony on Mars, but how this gargantuan feat would be accomplished remains unclear. Beyond the massive technical lift, populating such an outpost once humans arrived on the red planet is another challenge. One option Musk has proposed, according to a Thursday report by The New York Times, is to use his sperm to birth new Mars residents.\nThe Times report, based on anonymous sources, said “Musk has volunteered his sperm to help se...\n\n\"The Boring Company wasn’t just about building underground freeways—its real purpose was to bore into Martian hills for habitation, the most economical and efficient way to settle there,” Cantrell said. “The Cybertruck is fully pressurized because it’s designed for Mars, and it’s electric because solar energy is the only viable power source there.\"\n\nCantrell did acknowledge that one million people in 20 years is ambitious but said SpaceX is up to the task.\n\n“That’s what Starship is for, and SpaceX is close to making it work,” he said. “We’ve never built anything this big or ambitious; it’s fascinating to watch.\"\n\nTo build excitement for the mission to Mars, SpaceX launched a March Madness promotion last week where the perfect bracket winner could win a trip to Mars on a SpaceX Starship.\n\nDespite his optimism, skeptics argue that Musk's vision of a \"self-sustaining colony\" on Mars is unrealistic, misleading, and a promotional stunt.\n\n“The only way to achieve that is by going underground. Mars is uninhabitable due to extreme radiation,” journalist and podcast host Jim Stewartson wrote on X. “It’s a barren, frozen, and worthless rock, 140 million miles away. This is nothing more than a hoax to steal your money.”\n\nBut in his interview with Cruz, Musk claimed that Mars is a stepping stone to understanding the universe.\n\n“I have a philosophy of curiosity. I want to understand the universe, which requires exploring other planets, star systems, and galaxies,” Musk said. “We may find alien civilizations or their remnants, gaining insight into where the universe is going, where it came from, and the questions we have yet to ask about the universe.”\n\nSpaceX has faced several setbacks in its quest for Mars, including losing one of its Starship spacecraft over the Turks and Caicos in January due to an in-flight failure that the company called a “rapid unscheduled disassembly.”\n\nYou can breathe now, the Earth isn’t going to end by an asteroid hit—yet.\nAstronomers monitoring a potentially catastrophic asteroid have seen its odds of hitting Earth drop dramatically, as new observations refined its predicted trajectory.\nThe impact probability of asteroid 2024 YR4 has fallen from 2.8% to just 0.16%, according to the latest data from the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. This significant reduction comes after refined orbital calculations based on...\n\nMusk’s designs on Mars likely depend on his continued good relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, who, during his inauguration speech in January, said going to Mars was part of America’s “manifest destiny.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev said the Kremlin wants to work with Musk to strengthen its space agency, Roscosmos, Reuters reported.\n\n\"I think that there will undoubtedly be a discussion with Musk in the near future,\" Dmitriev reportedly said during a recent conference in Moscow.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: Adds comments from Phantom Space CEO Jim Cantrell\n\n$86,037.00\n\n$2,015.62\n\n$2.50\n\n$621.73\n\n$134.12\n\n$0.999874\n\n$0.735587\n\n$0.175122\n\n$0.231507\n\n$2,013.41\n\n$85,804.00\n\n$14.74\n\n$9.82\n\n$3.65\n\n$0.287418\n\n$2,409.68\n\n$0.999901\n\n$0.195297\n\n$1.18\n\n$19.27\n\n$2.48\n\n$0.00001288\n\n$92.72\n\n$345.64\n\n$4.49\n\n$6.87\n\n$2,014.56\n\n$4.75\n\n$0.99971\n\n$1.001\n\n$14.80\n\n$2,139.26\n\n$28.68\n\n$6.86\n\n$209.52\n\n$1.044\n\n$5.51\n\n$2.74\n\n$1.16\n\n$0.00000758\n\n$51.80\n\n$5.91\n\n$22.65\n\n$0.872846\n\n$18.21\n\n$0.813513\n\n$33.87\n\n$178.07\n\n$86,021.00\n\n$11.43\n\n$0.02653526\n\n$0.083181\n\n$262.64\n\n$0.998965\n\n$4.74\n\n$0.080677\n\n$0.389848\n\n$3.09\n\n$0.218323\n\n$85,822.00\n\n$3.32\n\n$0.377112\n\n$3.35\n\n$4.03\n\n$0.542453\n\n$0.198234\n\n$0.00256139\n\n$1.001\n\n$0.903769\n\n$0.539934\n\n$5.57\n\n$0.539747\n\n$11.28\n\n$85,957.00\n\n$1.00\n\n$2,014.00\n\n$78.52\n\n$2,091.98\n\n$0.454347\n\n$1.11\n\n$0.070701\n\n$1,287.68\n\n$19.09\n\n$0.913947\n\n$0.580715\n\n$2,271.60\n\n$0.654527\n\n$139.34\n\n$0.997716\n\n$10.01\n\n$0.200124\n\n$0.954535\n\n$0.097937\n\n$0.01522035\n\n$1.014\n\n$0.595237\n\n$0.00001167\n\n$1.00\n\n$85,463.00\n\n$2,134.57\n\n$1.001\n\n$621.67\n\n$0.01760063\n\n$1.001\n\n$0.727575\n\n$3,049.76\n\n$1.00\n\n$2.47\n\n$0.293029\n\n$0.189263\n\n$0.01436146\n\n$35.02\n\n$0.0000007\n\n$85,803.00\n\n$0.433532\n\n$6.21\n\n$2.18\n\n$3,058.99\n\n$0.110051\n\n$171.23\n\n$2,095.75\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.00006356\n\n$0.00655102\n\n$8.53\n\n$0.451319\n\n$17.62\n\n$3.23\n\n$146.67\n\n$0.514497\n\n$1.92\n\n$0.153757\n\n$3.47\n\n$34.46\n\n$1.00\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.07578\n\n$0.683149\n\n$18.36\n\n$0.274276\n\n$0.496944\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.794461\n\n$84,279.00\n\n$2,137.22\n\n$0.476395\n\n$0.171507\n\n$7.07\n\n$2,014.56\n\n$0.091121\n\n$0.224813\n\n$0.174888\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.685846\n\n$0.00002242\n\n$0.04635715\n\n$85,966.00\n\n$0.00000044\n\n$1.24\n\n$0.00693011\n\n$2,016.22\n\n$86,111.00\n\n$0.535231\n\n$0.527245\n\n$2,014.43\n\n$110.37\n\n$1.083\n\n$2.50\n\n$0.990872\n\n$0.43099\n\n$0.01204155\n\n$43.61\n\n$1.081\n\n$0.218392\n\n$0.40509\n\n$2,099.02\n\n$5.53\n\n$0.00714339\n\n$0.894737\n\n$0.36982\n\n$2,049.27\n\n$2,013.53\n\n$1.30\n\n$0.00006569\n\n$85,892.00\n\n$21.74\n\n$0.99861\n\n$0.00413486\n\n$85,394.00\n\n$1.39\n\n$129.76\n\n$1.001\n\n$1.39\n\n$0.268915\n\n$0.00587075\n\n$0.03300476\n\n$1.002\n\n$0.282539\n\n$1,995.15\n\n$0.896044\n\n$2,013.84\n\n$3.84\n\n$1.21\n\n$0.03035603\n\n$24.25\n\n$2,199.76\n\n$17.89\n\n$0.210305\n\n$1.18\n\n$0.285464\n\n$2,127.75\n\n$0.654846\n\n$2.55\n\n$85,957.00\n\n$85,833.00\n\n$0.551381\n\n$2.89\n\n$0.00000134\n\n$41.09\n\n$0.03887709\n\n$0.0337062\n\n$0.072352\n\n$2,187.08\n\n$1.00\n\n$2,012.18\n\n$1.00\n\n$3,041.40\n\n$0.00000012\n\n$0.00340914\n\n$0.03323006\n\n$0.086865\n\n$0.01284301\n\n$0.00243061\n\n$143.47\n\n$0.109172\n\n$2.31\n\n$0.684272\n\n$1,726.98\n\n$0.11857\n\n$0.99923\n\n$0.00519082\n\n$4.24\n\n$0.156559\n\n$0.272656\n\n$0.416088\n\n$0.0026158\n\n$0.538069\n\n$0.03332886\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk has frequently expressed his desire to build a colony on Mars, but how this gargantuan feat would be accomplished remains unclear.

You have to build all that on Mars, which is a hostile environment.”\n\nOn Friday, Musk said that SpaceX plans to launch a Starship to Mars in 2026, carrying Tesla Optimus Robots. If all goes well with that mission, then humans are expected to launch to Mars in 2029.\n\nSince founding SpaceX in 2002, Musk has prioritized colonizing the Red Planet. He has even pledged to donate his sperm to \"help seed a colony,\" according to a New York Times report that cited unnamed sources.\n\n“The way to look at anything Elon Musk does is through the lens of Mars,” Jim Cantrell, founder and CEO of Phantom Space, told Decrypt. “I know because I spent time with them in the early days before these issues arose—this is his entire life goal.”\n\nBefore founding the Tuscon-based aerospace company Phantom Space, Cantrell served as SpaceX's first Vice President of Business Development.\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk has frequently expressed his desire to build a colony on Mars, but how this gargantuan feat would be accomplished remains unclear.

Yakovenko said that he should have come out more forcefully about the ad amid the initial pushback.\n\n“The ad was bad, and it’s still gnawing at my soul. I am ashamed I downplayed it instead of just calling it what it is—mean and punching down on a marginalized group,” posted Yakovenko, the CEO of Solana Labs. “I’ll do whatever I can to make sure Solana Foundation stays focused on its mission of decentralization and open source software development, and out of culture wars.”\n\nThe ad was bad, and it’s still gnawing at my soul. I am ashamed I downplayed it instead of just calling it what it is - mean and punching down on a marginalized group. I am grateful for the ecosystem devs and artists that immediately called it what it is both publicly and…\n\n— toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) March 19, 2025\n\nThough many were highly critical of the ad, Yakovenko’s reflection was met with mostly positive responses. “I love you owning this directly,” said prominent investor and entrepreneur, Sam Lessin.

Yakovenko said that he should have come out more forcefully about the ad amid the initial pushback.\n\n“The ad was bad, and it’s still gnawing at my soul. I am ashamed I downplayed it instead of just calling it what it is—mean and punching down on a marginalized group,” posted Yakovenko, the CEO of Solana Labs. “I’ll do whatever I can to make sure Solana Foundation stays focused on its mission of decentralization and open source software development, and out of culture wars.”\n\nThe ad was bad, and it’s still gnawing at my soul.
