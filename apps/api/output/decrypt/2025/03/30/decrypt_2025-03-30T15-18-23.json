A tweet or a regulatory shift can send prices soaring, while unexpected market shocks like trade wars can wipe out billions of dollars in minutes. This volatility is behind two key terms that define cryptocurrency market cycles: bull and bear markets.\n\nUnderstanding these trends isn’t just about knowing when to buy or sell—it’s about survival. The differences between a bull and bear market are simple yet complex. A bull market fuels optimism, risk-taking, and price surges, while a bear market brings fear, sell-offs, and a test of investor resilience.\n\nThis article will explain what defines these market conditions, and how they impact cryptocurrency.\n\nThe terms \"bull market\" and \"bear market\" date back to the 18th century. A bull charges with its horns upward, symbolizing rising prices, while a bear swipes downward, representing a market decline.\n\nIn traditional equities markets, a bull market is generally defined as a sustained period of rising stock prices, typically lasting months or years, with gains of 20% or more. With a few key differences, bull and bear markets in crypto function much the same as traditional finance. Unlike legacy markets, however, crypto cycles are amplified by:\n\nCryptocurrency investors rely on technical, macroeconomic, and on-chain analysis to identify trends and effectively navigate market cycles.\n\n“Standard technical analysis tools like moving averages, Relative Strength Index, and Bollinger Bands, can help signal cyclical shifts along with correlated markets such as the NASDAQ and Tech Stocks,” Mike Marshall, Amberdata’s head of research, told Decrypt. “Additionally, macro factors, including Fed policy, inflation, and global events, also heavily influence crypto cycles.”\n\nOn January 20, 2025, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,786, spurred on by the hope of a friendlier regulatory environment in the United States under newly re-elected President Donald Trump, who had promised the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\n\nThe price of price of Bitcoin has hit yet another all-time high of just under $109,000, amid widespread optimism in the crypto industry as Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. President draws near.\nBitcoin has retreated slightly from its new all-time high of $108,786, per CoinGecko, and now sits at $107,949, up 3.2% in the past 24 hours and 16.2% on the week.\n\nThe news follows Trump’s mention of Bitcoin in a speech on Sunday, where he name checked how, “Bitcoin has shattered one record high after...\n\nSome analysts speculated that the industry was in a bull market, with some even calling it a 'supercycle'—a prolonged period of economic expansion driven by sustained demand and investor optimism. However, that narrative was challenged when Bitcoin tumbled more than 31% to nearly $73,000 two months later.\n\n“Everyone seemed to be saying that when the Trump administration comes in, it's going to give such a huge boost to crypto regulations,” Alice Liu, Head of Research at CoinMarketCap, told Decrypt at ETH Denver. “But so far, we haven't seen that play out in action.”\n\nHowever, as Liu explained, this drop in Bitcoin’s price did not necessarily mean a bear market had taken over.\n\n“This is a technical pullback as opposed to a structural change. The reason for that is the liquidity is still healthy,” she said.\n\nLiquidity—how easily assets can be bought and sold without significantly impacting price—is key in distinguishing bull and bear markets. High liquidity indicates a market where transactions occur smoothly, with minimal price volatility, due to a large number of active buyers and sellers. In bear markets, liquidity tends to dry up as trading slows, amplifying price volatility.\n\n“Even in reaction to the market shock, we saw a definite spike in trade volume, averaging around $150 million to $160 million daily,” Liu said. “And even now, as the dust has settled a little, we still see a healthy trade volume moving through the market.”\n\nDefining the start of a Bitcoin bull market isn’t always straightforward, since different analysts use varying metrics to pinpoint its beginning. Some argue that it starts when prices recover from a major downturn, while others believe it only becomes clear once previous all-time highs are surpassed.\n\nBitcoin’s bull run is going to continue—thanks to the big money institutions. \nThat’s according to a report from global investment firm Bernstein, which said on Monday that investors should be prepared for a further rally in the asset and equities related to it. \nAnalysts Gautam Chhugani, Mahika Sapra, and Sanskar Chindalia wrote that the bull run was ignited by the prospect and later approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., and then pushed on by the election of crypto-friendly Don...\n\n“Technically, one could say the bull market begins with capitulation, as prices start to rise, but most people only perceive a bull market in Bitcoin after the prior all-time high is reached until the bubble pops about a year later,” Michael Terpin, founder and CEO of Transform Ventures, told Decrypt.\n\nCapitulation is when an investor, often driven by fear or panic, gives up on trying to recover losses and sells their assets. This typically happens after a prolonged market downturn triggered by a massive event, like the collapse of FTX in November 2022.\n\nInvestors who hold onto their cryptocurrency despite being in a bear market, and mounting pressures to sell, are considered to have “diamond hands.”\n\nThe term \"diamond hands\" originated in 2018 on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit.\n\nNot all financial analysts agree that a 20% swing should be considered the standard for measuring whether a market is in bull or bear territory.\n\n“I think the typical 20% threshold that’s commonly used to define bull and bear markets in traditional finance may not be as applicable to crypto, due to the wider price moves in the latter and the 24/7 trading that makes crypto more sensitive to global events,” Coinbase Head of Institutional Research David Duong told Decrypt.\n\nAs Duong explained, crypto is often used as a proxy when traditional markets are closed, increasing the magnitude of the reaction to crypto prices.\n\n“I’d be more inclined to use metrics like the 200-day moving average, in combination with measuring the sustainability of the given upside or downside move,” he said. “For example, how long the move lasts to define a bull or bear market.”\n\nWhile crypto markets share similarities with traditional financial markets, they have unique characteristics—including extreme volatility, higher sensitivity to hype, and regulatory changes that set them apart.\n\n“When it comes to cryptocurrency-specific technical indicators, I prefer the Market Value to Realized Value ratio or the MVRV z-score to gauge how markets are moving,” Duong said.\n\nInvestor sentiment plays an important role in shaping market cycles, with various indicators offering insights into broad trends. Measures like the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), the Put/Call Ratio, and the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey help gauge investor confidence and risk appetite.\n\nOne widely followed metric, the Fear and Greed Index, aggregates market factors to assess whether investors lean toward caution or excitement. The Fear and Greed Index ranges from 0 to 100, with lower values indicating fear, suggesting cautious or bearish investor sentiment, and higher values reflecting greed, signaling optimism or bullish market behavior.\n\nOn March 30, 2025, as of this writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stood at 32 (Fear), up from 17 (Extreme Fear) earlier in the month. While such indices don’t predict price movements, they often reflect broader shifts in investor thinking.\n\n“Investors often look to sentiment as a key indicator to assess whether markets are nearing a top or bottom,” Joe Vezzani, CEO and co-founder of crypto sentiment aggregator LunarCrush, told Decrypt. “Current crypto market sentiment reached its lowest point since August 2024, when volatility spiked due to the unwinding of the yen carry trade.”\n\nFor financial analyst Jacob King, founder and CEO of WhaleWire, market sentiment also depends on whether investors believe the data.\n\n“Indicators exist—if you trust the data, which is questionable,” King told Decrypt. “Bitcoin falling below the 200-day moving average is a major red flag. When bulls fail to hold that line, the market structure weakens, and declines accelerate.”\n\nBitcoin market sentiment has deteriorated to levels not seen since January 2023, according to crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant.\nIn a report released Thursday, CryptoQuant revealed its Bull Score Index has fallen to 20 — showing only two out of ten key metrics in bullish territory.\nThis reading marks the lowest level in over two years and sits well below the threshold historically needed to support sustained price appreciation, the analytics firm said.\nBecause it returns to a previous low, a \"we...\n\nMarkets go through natural growth and decline cycles. While no strategy guarantees success, those who take a long-term, well-researched approach are better positioned to navigate financial uncertainties.\n\n“It's important to note that what defines a bull market in crypto today isn’t just price—it’s utility, infrastructure maturity, and institutional participation,” Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, told Decrypt. “When it comes down to it, the key indicators are transaction volume acceleration, fee growth, stablecoin velocity, and capital formation on-chain.

When bulls fail to hold that line, the market structure weakens, and declines accelerate.”\n\nBitcoin market sentiment has deteriorated to levels not seen since January 2023, according to crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant.\nIn a report released Thursday, CryptoQuant revealed its Bull Score Index has fallen to 20 — showing only two out of ten key metrics in bullish territory.\nThis reading marks the lowest level in over two years and sits well below the threshold historically needed to support sustained price appreciation, the analytics firm said.\nBecause it returns to a previous low, a \"we...\n\nMarkets go through natural growth and decline cycles. While no strategy guarantees success, those who take a long-term, well-researched approach are better positioned to navigate financial uncertainties.\n\n“It's important to note that what defines a bull market in crypto today isn’t just price—it’s utility, infrastructure maturity, and institutional participation,” Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, told Decrypt. “When it comes down to it, the key indicators are transaction volume acceleration, fee growth, stablecoin velocity, and capital formation on-chain. That’s when you know the next wave is real.”\n\nSign up for free online courses covering the most important core topics in the crypto universe and earn your on-chain certificate - demonstrating your new knowledge of major Web3 topics.\n\nAs Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, nations and institutions are beginning to treat it as more than just a speculative asset—with some looking to stockpile it as a strategic reserve, much like gold.\nA strategic Bitcoin reserve is a stockpile of BTC held by an entity, such as a government or institution, for strategic or financial purposes. In 2024, leading up to the U.S. Presidential election, then-candidate Donald Trump and others proposed the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve fo...\n\nToday, Strategy is one of the most important institutions in cryptocurrency, but it didn’t start out that way. Originally called MicroStrategy, the company co-founded by Michael Saylor—one of the most influential figures in the world of Bitcoin—first made its mark in software.\nNow, however, it’s best known for its aggressive strategy of acquiring Bitcoin for its corporate reserves, with Saylor becoming a key figurehead for the institutional adoption of the asset.\nHere’s everything else you need...\n\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, has transformed the crypto trading landscape, but many protocols suffer from a persistent problem: high price slippage.\nPoor liquidity means orders aren't fulfilled at the desired rates—effectively amounting to a tax on frustrated traders. Crippling slippage is exacerbated by clunky bridges, high fees and slow confirmation times, resulting in frustrating experiences for end users.\nThat pushes DeFi enthusiasts back to centralized exchanges, which custody users' ass...\n\n",

    "full_content": "# This Week in Bitcoin: GameStop Reveals Reserve, But Inflation Fears Rear Their Head\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nBitcoin swung up and down—as usual—over the last week, and while things were looking up midweek, familiar inflation fears helped sink the price by the time Friday rolled around.\n\nThe coin's price was recently at $82,480 per coin, according to CoinGecko, after hitting a nearly three-week high of $88,474 on Monday. As of this writing, Bitcoin is now down by almost 2% on the week.\n\nBitcoin's dip came after the U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE, was up 0.4% in February—its largest monthly increase in over a year.\n\nTraders are still hesitant with risk-assets like Bitcoin and stocks (which also dropped Friday) as persistent inflation and President Trump's trade war continue to unsettle the markets. Still, it was an interesting week for Bitcoin.\n\nAmerican Bitcoin ETFs took in new investor cash each day from Monday through Thursday, Farside Investors data shows—but finally showed red on Friday amid the broader markets shock.\n\nEven so, the week's total inflows ended up in the green at approximately $196.4 million. It may not sound like much, but after massive outflows last month, it looks like crypto investors are seeing Bitcoin's current price—24% below its January all-time high—as a buying opportunity.\n\nHow low could Bitcoin go? \nTo quote Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett: “I don’t believe anybody knows what the market is going to do tomorrow.”\nStill, investors have been searching for answers since Bitcoin’s price started dipping after U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Amid twists and turns in his trade policy, Bitcoin’s price hit $77,000 two weeks ago, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko.\nEven though the asset's price was changing hands around $88,000 on...\n\nVideo game retailer and popular meme stock GameStop updated its Investment Policy on Tuesday to inform investors that it would add \"certain cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin\" to its balance sheet.\n\nThe firm then said Wednesday that it would follow in the footsteps of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and raise money from investors in the form of debt to buy the asset. GameStop aims to raise $1.3 billion to aid in its Bitcoin acquisition goal.\n\nAn announcement regarding Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/gG8JRarIok\n\n— GameStop (@gamestop) March 25, 2025\n\nGameStop first made headlines in 2021 when amateur traders started buying its moribund stock and pumping its price—leading to the meme stock phenomenon.\n\nIt's now trying to strengthen its books by buying \"digital gold.\" But while the price of GME stock rose on the initial news this week, it's since plunged following word of the raise, as GameStop investors don't seem too keen on raising money for the ploy.\n\nPublic Keys is a weekly roundup from Decrypt that tracks the key publicly traded crypto companies. This week: GameStop makes a big splash with its Bitcoin announcement, then fumbles with a debt offering; BTC miners are in for a world of hurt as fees shrink; and Robinhood gets a New Jersey slap on the wrist for its prediction market debut.\nGameStop presses play on Bitcoin\nThere was a lot of excitement for GameStop’s Q4 earnings report because it was heavily hinted—and then confirmed—that the comp...\n\nBitcoiners arrived in Fort Lauderdale this week for the world's biggest mining conference: Mining Disrupt.\n\nEngineers from the top manufacturing companies and vendors pushed a narrative that miners should be dipping their toes into the world of AI data centers to raise their game as BTC's price dips and difficulty continues to climb.\n\nAs Bitcoin mining grows more competitive and challenging, industry leaders are looking to cash in on AI data centers—but it’s no easy feat. \nAt the Mining Disrupt conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida this week, leading miners said navigating the shift to AI requires skill and care. \n“In the long-term, [AI] is a big trend,” Paul Li, CEO of mining technology provider Fog Hashing, said during a talk. “We cannot miss that. You [miners] need to go far this year, as the demand for compute power AI c...\n\nDecrypt was there to see if it really was as simple as that, and also learned that small businesses are tempted to start the trade in their backyard—but not by mining BTC: DOGE ASICs are still hot, apparently.\n\nThe world's richest country may be keen on stacking sats via a strategic reserve—but will the move inspire other nation states?\n\nIn short, it looks like it: Brazil, the second biggest economy in the America's and biggest in Latin America, might be doing so soon.\n\nPedro Giocondo Guerra, a bigwig in leftist President Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, said that buying and holding Bitcoin would be \"in the (country’s) public interest.\"\n\nA high-ranking official in Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration declared Tuesday that a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve would be \"determinant for our prosperity\" and \"in the (country’s) public interest.\"\nPedro Giocondo Guerra, chief of staff to Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, made the remarks while officially representing the federal government at a congressional ceremony.\nDebating the establishment of a sovereign bitcoin reserve rigorously is a matter of public int...\n\nGuerra, who is chief of staff to Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, made the comment at a congressional ceremony.\n\nBrazil has a huge crypto market—the biggest in South America—and the Brazilian real was the worst-performing major currency last year.

As of this writing, Bitcoin is now down by almost 2% on the week.\n\nBitcoin's dip came after the U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE, was up 0.4% in February—its largest monthly increase in over a year.\n\nTraders are still hesitant with risk-assets like Bitcoin and stocks (which also dropped Friday) as persistent inflation and President Trump's trade war continue to unsettle the markets. Still, it was an interesting week for Bitcoin.\n\nAmerican Bitcoin ETFs took in new investor cash each day from Monday through Thursday, Farside Investors data shows—but finally showed red on Friday amid the broader markets shock.\n\nEven so, the week's total inflows ended up in the green at approximately $196.4 million. It may not sound like much, but after massive outflows last month, it looks like crypto investors are seeing Bitcoin's current price—24% below its January all-time high—as a buying opportunity.\n\nHow low could Bitcoin go? \nTo quote Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett: “I don’t believe anybody knows what the market is going to do tomorrow.”\nStill, investors have been searching for answers since Bitcoin’s price started dipping after U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

    "full_content": "# What is Dogwifhat (WIF)? The Solana Dog Meme Coin With a Hat\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nWhat do you get when a cute dog puts on an even cuter hat? A meme coin, of course!\n\nMeme coin investors love dogs, and a photo of a pooch sporting a pink woven hat went viral—and took the crypto world by storm, spawning its own Solana-based meme coin, Dogwifhat (WIF).\n\nIn true degen fashion, WIF is “literally just a dog wif a hat,” per its official site, with no promises of revolutionary technology or actual utility. Despite this, Dogwifhat rapidly rose to become one of the biggest meme coins by market cap after it first barked in November 2023, even as its value has fluctuated wildly over time.\n\nMemes have always been part of crypto culture—so it was perhaps inevitable that they would be financialized using the same technology that birthed cryptocurrencies.\nInitially, meme coins like Dogecoin were created as a joke, poking fun at cryptocurrencies—but, in true decentralized fashion, they’ve evolved beyond their creators’ original intentions.\nWith their highly volatile prices shaped by influencers and rapidly moving news cycles, meme coins have become a growing sector of the crypto econom...\n\nDogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchainblockchain, with a community that often says “the hat stays on” as a sign of support. It gained popularity due to die-hard support from the crypto community, led by influencers such as Ansem—who amassed a sizable following while championing the token.\n\nThere really isn’t much more to it—no high-tech barkitecture here. Like they said, it’s literally just a dog wif a hat.\n\nThe hat stays on.\n\n— Jakey (@SolJakey) April 19, 2024\n\nWIF went live in November 2023, according to a tweet from its official account, before hitting its all-time high of $4.83 and a market cap of $4.58 billion on March 31.\n\nEarly Dogwifhat pioneers struggled through the first month of “HODLing” the token, only to see substantial gains in subsequent weeks.\n\nIn December 2023, the coin saw a 2,000x price swing in a course of a single month, and one trader turned $300 of WIF that they purchased the day the token launched into $300,000. While another investor claims to have made hundreds of thousands over the same period becoming a WIF millionaire.\n\n“The dog is wearing a hat, and every time I looked at the meme it made me laugh,” the WIF millionaire tweeted. “That’s it.”\n\nMeme coins are great. They’re fun and they onboard a ton of new users into the space—and every once in a while, they break through the on-chain noise and become new pillars of community for people to rally around, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), BONK, or Dogecoin (DOGE).\nThey’re a great tool for onboarding and an even better tool for gambling. They also represent a problem that crypto has faced since the advent of Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens, and arguably even before then.\nAs long as there are gamblers will...\n\nHowever, while it may have avoided burning out like the majority of meme coins, WIF has displayed significant volatility over the course of its existence.\n\nIn November 2024, it almost reclaimed it all-time high, touching $4.19 and a market cap of $4.2 billion. By March 2025, however, the token had plummeted to nearly $0.43—a drop of 91% from its all-time high.\n\nNamed Achi (previously known as Chi-Chi), the dog in question is a Shiba Inu—a popular breed of dog within the crypto community, having become the face of the original meme coin, Dogecoin.\n\nAchi is now about six years old, with the viral photo having being taken two months after she was born on September 15, 2018.\n\nAchi currently lives in South Korea with her owners, who personally knitted the adorable hat themselves. Initially, her owners reacted positively to their dog’s newfound fame, taking to Instagram to announce an NFT auction of the original, iconic photo of Achi.\n\nUnfortunately, this stirred up a bone of contention with the Solana community as the NFT was being minted on the Ethereum blockchain—rather than on Solana, the home of the meme coin. This came after Achi’s parents attempted to work with a Solana developer, launching an ACHI token, but the owners were shortly rug-pulled—it’s a dog-eat-dog world. After this ruff experience, the owners turned to an Ethereum-based online community to help out. Still, the Solana community wasn't happy and complaints kept flying.\n\nAn Ethereum NFT photo of the original Dogwifhat meme—which inspired one of the hottest Solana meme coins of the moment, WIF—was sold for a whopping $4.3 million worth of ETH early Monday, narrowly surpassing the previous record held for most expensive meme NFT ever sold. \nThe on-chain image of a Shiba Inu puppy in a knit beanie sold for 1,210.759 ETH early Monday, a sum worth $4,311,234 at the time of the transaction. The NFT sold to GCR, a prominent pseudonymous crypto trader, via an auction on...\n\n“Please don’t insult [Achi] and us,” the owners wrote in a pinned comment on the Instagram post, attempting to muzzle the haters. “You have no reason to blame us. Please cheer for us.”\n\nOn March 18, the iconic photo of Achi sold for 1,210.759 ETH (around $4.27 million at the time).\n\nIf you’re wanting more pictures of Achi, just head over to her owner's Instagram account, which has documented her life over the past six years.\n\nWhile we know the dog wif the hat is Achi, the meme originated from professional Fortnite player and streamer Issa, who set the picture as his Twitter profile picture in 2019—to which a user replied, “Dogwifhat.”\n\nMore people in the Fortnite scene started changing their profile pictures to the iconic dog picture, with Issa tweeting “dogwifhat taking over.” Soon players, streamers, and organizations from other esports games like Rocket League got involved.\n\nIn the meme’s next evolution, people began adding the dog’s hat to esports organizations, hypebeast brands, and other memes. This was when YouTuber Keemstar got involved, setting his Twitter profile picture to the dog wearing a hat with his logo on.\n\n#dogwifhat 🤝 @lolesports pic.twitter.com/k7vxqJpoSl\n\n— LEC (@LEC) December 27, 2019\n\nClaiming to be the creator of the dogwifhat meme, Issa sold a figurine of Achi through YouTooz.

The Solana Dog Meme Coin With a Hat\n\nWhat do you get when a cute dog puts on an even cuter hat? A meme coin, of course!\n\nMeme coin investors love dogs, and a photo of a pooch sporting a pink woven hat went viral—and took the crypto world by storm, spawning its own Solana-based meme coin, Dogwifhat (WIF).\n\nIn true degen fashion, WIF is “literally just a dog wif a hat,” per its official site, with no promises of revolutionary technology or actual utility. Despite this, Dogwifhat rapidly rose to become one of the biggest meme coins by market cap after it first barked in November 2023, even as its value has fluctuated wildly over time.\n\nMemes have always been part of crypto culture—so it was perhaps inevitable that they would be financialized using the same technology that birthed cryptocurrencies.\nInitially, meme coins like Dogecoin were created as a joke, poking fun at cryptocurrencies—but, in true decentralized fashion, they’ve evolved beyond their creators’ original intentions.\nWith their highly volatile prices shaped by influencers and rapidly moving news cycles, meme coins have become a growing sector of the crypto econom...\n\nDogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchainblockchain, with a community that often says “the hat stays on” as a sign of support. It gained popularity due to die-hard support from the crypto community, led by influencers such as Ansem—who amassed a sizable following while championing the token.\n\nThere really isn’t much more to it—no high-tech barkitecture here. Like they said, it’s literally just a dog wif a hat.\n\nThe hat stays on.\n\n— Jakey (@SolJakey) April 19, 2024\n\nWIF went live in November 2023, according to a tweet from its official account, before hitting its all-time high of $4.83 and a market cap of $4.58 billion on March 31.\n\nEarly Dogwifhat pioneers struggled through the first month of “HODLing” the token, only to see substantial gains in subsequent weeks.\n\nIn December 2023, the coin saw a 2,000x price swing in a course of a single month, and one trader turned $300 of WIF that they purchased the day the token launched into $300,000. While another investor claims to have made hundreds of thousands over the same period becoming a WIF millionaire.\n\n“The dog is wearing a hat, and every time I looked at the meme it made me laugh,” the WIF millionaire tweeted. “That’s it.”\n\nMeme coins are great. They’re fun and they onboard a ton of new users into the space—and every once in a while, they break through the on-chain noise and become new pillars of community for people to rally around, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), BONK, or Dogecoin (DOGE).\nThey’re a great tool for onboarding and an even better tool for gambling. They also represent a problem that crypto has faced since the advent of Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens, and arguably even before then.\nAs long as there are gamblers will...\n\nHowever, while it may have avoided burning out like the majority of meme coins, WIF has displayed significant volatility over the course of its existence.\n\nIn November 2024, it almost reclaimed it all-time high, touching $4.19 and a market cap of $4.2 billion. By March 2025, however, the token had plummeted to nearly $0.43—a drop of 91% from its all-time high.\n\nNamed Achi (previously known as Chi-Chi), the dog in question is a Shiba Inu—a popular breed of dog within the crypto community, having become the face of the original meme coin, Dogecoin.\n\nAchi is now about six years old, with the viral photo having being taken two months after she was born on September 15, 2018.\n\nAchi currently lives in South Korea with her owners, who personally knitted the adorable hat themselves. Initially, her owners reacted positively to their dog’s newfound fame, taking to Instagram to announce an NFT auction of the original, iconic photo of Achi.\n\nUnfortunately, this stirred up a bone of contention with the Solana community as the NFT was being minted on the Ethereum blockchain—rather than on Solana, the home of the meme coin. This came after Achi’s parents attempted to work with a Solana developer, launching an ACHI token, but the owners were shortly rug-pulled—it’s a dog-eat-dog world. After this ruff experience, the owners turned to an Ethereum-based online community to help out. Still, the Solana community wasn't happy and complaints kept flying.\n\nAn Ethereum NFT photo of the original Dogwifhat meme—which inspired one of the hottest Solana meme coins of the moment, WIF—was sold for a whopping $4.3 million worth of ETH early Monday, narrowly surpassing the previous record held for most expensive meme NFT ever sold. \nThe on-chain image of a Shiba Inu puppy in a knit beanie sold for 1,210.759 ETH early Monday, a sum worth $4,311,234 at the time of the transaction. The NFT sold to GCR, a prominent pseudonymous crypto trader, via an auction on...\n\n“Please don’t insult [Achi] and us,” the owners wrote in a pinned comment on the Instagram post, attempting to muzzle the haters. “You have no reason to blame us. Please cheer for us.”\n\nOn March 18, the iconic photo of Achi sold for 1,210.759 ETH (around $4.27 million at the time).\n\nIf you’re wanting more pictures of Achi, just head over to her owner's Instagram account, which has documented her life over the past six years.\n\nWhile we know the dog wif the hat is Achi, the meme originated from professional Fortnite player and streamer Issa, who set the picture as his Twitter profile picture in 2019—to which a user replied, “Dogwifhat.”\n\nMore people in the Fortnite scene started changing their profile pictures to the iconic dog picture, with Issa tweeting “dogwifhat taking over.” Soon players, streamers, and organizations from other esports games like Rocket League got involved.\n\nIn the meme’s next evolution, people began adding the dog’s hat to esports organizations, hypebeast brands, and other memes. This was when YouTuber Keemstar got involved, setting his Twitter profile picture to the dog wearing a hat with his logo on.\n\n#dogwifhat 🤝 @lolesports pic.twitter.com/k7vxqJpoSl\n\n— LEC (@LEC) December 27, 2019\n\nClaiming to be the creator of the dogwifhat meme, Issa sold a figurine of Achi through YouTooz.

But it’s been eight years since the Switch launched, and fans are getting antsy for Nintendo’s next big thing.\nLuckily, it's coming. Following years of leaks and rumors, and even a couple official acknowledgments that the next-gen model was coming, Nintendo formally revealed the Switch 2 console in January 2025.\n\nFrom what we know off...\n\nThe bigger handhelds offer something closer to a 1:1 experience to the Nintendo Switch, albeit with access to a massive array of PC games. The smaller handhelds, which focus on retro emulation, have a variety of prices, sizes, and form factors—so if one model looks too big or awkward to hold, then you can almost certainly find a quality alternative.\n\nSystems like the Steam Deck and its brethren have screens ranging from 7 to 9 inches—that’s ignoring Acer's comically oversized 11-inch Nitro Blaze 11—and weigh anywhere from 670 to almost 900 grams. For comparison, the 'biggest' Switch is the Nintendo Switch OLED edition, which has a 7-inch screen and weighs 420 grams with the controllers attached. The semi-portable Wii U tablet weighs 491 grams.\n\nLet's focus for a moment on Valve's Steam Deck, the most popular PC handheld and the closest thing the Switch has to a challenger. The deck weighs in at 673g with a 7-inch screen. If you dig around online, it's not hard to find plenty of comments about the Steam Deck being too heavy and much too big to be portable; there's even a market for lap pillows specifically for handhelds.\n\nEven the default Nintendo Switch borders on being too large to be portable for many people, especially once you take into account the need for some players to affix a case to protect the screen and those sensitive Joy-Con sticks and rails.\n\nAt first glance, the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn’t look all that different to the handheld console that it evolved from. A light recoloring, bigger screen, but what else? Anything… exciting? \nWell, eagle-eyed and conspiratorial thinkers have some ideas on what the two-minute trailer may have revealed without explicitly telling us.

We can't really estimate the weight, though, since power increases aren't necessarily going to scale linearly with weight.\n\nBut we're left wondering: Is a bigger system really what Nintendo fans want?\n\nPortability has always been a key aspect of Nintendo handhelds, from the Game & Watch units released in 1980, all the way up to the modern Nintendo Switch systems.\n\nAd campaigns for these systems show people playing them on trains, at hip rooftop parties attended by local youths, or in parks with children who are (for some reason) not screaming at each other. Even in home settings, recent ads often depict people playing the Switch not in docked mode on their televisions, but in full handheld mode.\n\nIt also seems to push against the kid-centric focus that Nintendo systems tend to have. The Nintendo Switch placed a firm flag in the ground with how small the Joy-Cons were: this system is for tiny hands. I don't know that the Switch 2 Joy-Cons are big enough to be a problem, but the extra size and weight are going to be that much more extreme to an eight-year-old compared to a 26-year-old's perception.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be a big beefy boy, regardless of its exact measurements in millimeters and grams. It's big even for a Nintendo handheld, given that it's larger than the Switch and likely heavier than even the Wii U tablet.\n\nIt almost seems like Nintendo is chasing the upscale handheld market with this size increase, rather than its devoted core audience—a mistake it made and learned from with the GameCube. Nintendo doesn't have to compete with Microsoft and Sony, so why should it? The same goes for trying to match these other handhelds in size and features.\n\nOr maybe Nintendo is just worried that people won't be able to see that it's new if the system isn't obviously bigger.

    "full_content": "# Dogecoin Started as a Joke, But DOGE Mining Is Getting Serious\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nElon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency made a comeback at the end of last year as retail investors flooded back into the market to snap up Dogecoin. The coin was launched as a joke in 2013, but has persisted over the years and remained prominent.\n\nBut just how serious is the business of mining the O.G. meme coin? People are actively buying the machines to do so, according to vendors at this year’s Mining Disrupt conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nThough the conference was heavily focused on the established business of Bitcoin mining—which is headlined by major, publicly traded firms and backed by President Trump—coins like DOGE and Litecoin (LTC) also require proof-of-work mining and reward miners for supporting each chain.\n\nIn fact, the machines that mine such alternative PoW cryptocurrencies often mine them at the same time—technically dubbed “merged mining”—which lets them boost their earnings. Vendors said that miners of all stripes, from solo participants all the way up to public companies, are showing interest in order to earn a bit of extra cash.\n\n“Mining DOGE or LTC can help miners maximize revenue,” said Payne Cong, head of business development at ElphaPex.\n\nAs Dogecoin makes a comeback off the back of Bitcoin’s surge, some may be pondering: Where did the asset come from? What’s it for? And what’s Tesla CEO Elon Musk got to do with it? \nThe original meme coin’s boom largely has the world’s richest man to thank.

    "full_content": "# Elon Musk Folds X Into xAI, Creating a $113 Billion Juggernaut\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nIn a consolidation of his tech businesses, X owner Elon Musk said in a post on Friday that xAI, the developers of Grok, had acquired X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock transaction. According to Musk, the merger values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44 billion in April 2022. By October 2024, Fidelity Investments adjusted the valuation of its stake in X, estimating the company’s overall value to be approximately $9.4 billion.\n\nThough its valuation had recovered somewhat by December 2024, it was still down a whopping 77% from Musk’s purchase price. How Musk arrived at a $33 billion valuation, in other words, would make for interesting reading.\n\n@xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt).\n\nSince its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at…\n\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025\n\nAlready the head of several companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, Musk launched xAI in July 2023, a year after purchasing Twitter. While he said the goal of xAI was to “understand reality,” an ongoing feud with former business partner OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was also a driving factor.\n\n“Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution, and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Musk wrote on X Friday. “The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.”\n\nCalling X “the digital town square,” Musk said the platform boasted over 600 million active users. However, Meta, which launched a rival social media platform, Threads, in July 2023, and Bluesky, which launched in February of that year, have been trying to woo away users.\n\nElon Musk's rebellious AI chatbot Grok, which was recently upgraded and made available to X users for free, is living up to its promise of being uncensored—just not in the way its creator likely intended.\nGrok3, which had been characterized by Musk as a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” basically thinks its progenitor is a liar and often yields answers that directly contradict Musk's own statements and political positions, creating a bizarre scenario where the billionaire's own technology appears to...\n\nBluesky's user count surpassed 27.44 million users in January 2025, many of whom had left Twitter after Musk’s takeover.

According to Musk, the merger values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44 billion in April 2022. By October 2024, Fidelity Investments adjusted the valuation of its stake in X, estimating the company’s overall value to be approximately $9.4 billion.\n\nThough its valuation had recovered somewhat by December 2024, it was still down a whopping 77% from Musk’s purchase price. How Musk arrived at a $33 billion valuation, in other words, would make for interesting reading.\n\n@xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction.

While he said the goal of xAI was to “understand reality,” an ongoing feud with former business partner OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was also a driving factor.\n\n“Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution, and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Musk wrote on X Friday. “The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.”\n\nCalling X “the digital town square,” Musk said the platform boasted over 600 million active users. However, Meta, which launched a rival social media platform, Threads, in July 2023, and Bluesky, which launched in February of that year, have been trying to woo away users.\n\nElon Musk's rebellious AI chatbot Grok, which was recently upgraded and made available to X users for free, is living up to its promise of being uncensored—just not in the way its creator likely intended.\nGrok3, which had been characterized by Musk as a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” basically thinks its progenitor is a liar and often yields answers that directly contradict Musk's own statements and political positions, creating a bizarre scenario where the billionaire's own technology appears to...\n\nBluesky's user count surpassed 27.44 million users in January 2025, many of whom had left Twitter after Musk’s takeover.

    "full_content": "# FDIC Clears Path for Bank Crypto Activities Without Prior Approval\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nBanks can engage in cryptocurrency and other legally permitted activities without seeking prior regulatory approval, so long as they manage risks appropriately, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced Friday.\n\nThe policy change rescinds a 2022 requirement that mandated FDIC-supervised institutions notify the agency before engaging in crypto-related activities. Under the new guidance, banks can offer services involving digital assets without the agency's advance permission.\n\n\"With today's action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,\" FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said in a statement. \"I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.\"\n\nThe move aligns with similar actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which earlier this month reaffirmed that national banks can engage in certain crypto activities, including custody services and stablecoin transactions.\n\nThis regulatory shift marks a stark departure from the Biden administration's approach to cryptocurrency and banking relationships. Documents released earlier this year through Freedom of Information Act requests showed the FDIC frequently deterred banks from offering crypto-related services, critics claimed.\n\nThe previous regulatory stance had drawn criticism from lawmakers who started investigations into what some called \"Operation Chokepoint 2.0,\" a reference to an Obama-era initiative that targeted certain industries including firearms dealers and payday lenders. Critics claimed the Biden administration had similarly targeted the cryptocurrency industry through banking restrictions.\n\nIn its new Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025), the FDIC clarified that \"FDIC-supervised institutions may engage in permissible crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval.\"\n\nThe reversal follows months of pressure from cryptocurrency advocates and completes a significant pivot in federal banking policy. Industry representatives had accused regulators of using informal pressure tactics, including concerns about \"reputational risk,\" to discourage banks from serving cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nAmerican Bankers Association President and CEO Rob Nichols praised the decision. \"We welcome FDIC’s new guidance allowing supervised institutions to engage in permissible crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval,” he said in an official statement. “America’s banks are actively evaluating ways to compete safely and responsibly across the financial services ecosystem, and this type of regulatory clarity is critical to enhancing innovation in the space.\"\n\nAmerican banks seeking to offer customers services built on public blockchain networks appear to have been discouraged from doing so by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, documents released Friday revealed. \nThe disclosure came courtesy of a trove of newly unredacted crypto-related correspondences between the FDIC and member banks. San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase obtained the documents via the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. Last month, Coinbase secured heavily...\n\nThe FDIC emphasized that banks still need to consider various risks associated with crypto activities, including market and liquidity risks, operational and cybersecurity concerns, consumer protection requirements, and anti-money laundering obligations. The agency noted that institutions \"should engage with their supervisory team as appropriate\" when pursuing such activities.\n\nFriday's announcement comes as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to remove hurdles for digital assets.

Under the new guidance, banks can offer services involving digital assets without the agency's advance permission.\n\n\"With today's action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,\" FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said in a statement. \"I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.\"\n\nThe move aligns with similar actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which earlier this month reaffirmed that national banks can engage in certain crypto activities, including custody services and stablecoin transactions.\n\nThis regulatory shift marks a stark departure from the Biden administration's approach to cryptocurrency and banking relationships. Documents released earlier this year through Freedom of Information Act requests showed the FDIC frequently deterred banks from offering crypto-related services, critics claimed.\n\nThe previous regulatory stance had drawn criticism from lawmakers who started investigations into what some called \"Operation Chokepoint 2.0,\" a reference to an Obama-era initiative that targeted certain industries including firearms dealers and payday lenders. Critics claimed the Biden administration had similarly targeted the cryptocurrency industry through banking restrictions.\n\nIn its new Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025), the FDIC clarified that \"FDIC-supervised institutions may engage in permissible crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval.\"\n\nThe reversal follows months of pressure from cryptocurrency advocates and completes a significant pivot in federal banking policy. Industry representatives had accused regulators of using informal pressure tactics, including concerns about \"reputational risk,\" to discourage banks from serving cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nAmerican Bankers Association President and CEO Rob Nichols praised the decision. \"We welcome FDIC’s new guidance allowing supervised institutions to engage in permissible crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval,” he said in an official statement. “America’s banks are actively evaluating ways to compete safely and responsibly across the financial services ecosystem, and this type of regulatory clarity is critical to enhancing innovation in the space.\"\n\nAmerican banks seeking to offer customers services built on public blockchain networks appear to have been discouraged from doing so by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, documents released Friday revealed. \nThe disclosure came courtesy of a trove of newly unredacted crypto-related correspondences between the FDIC and member banks.

Last month, Coinbase secured heavily...\n\nThe FDIC emphasized that banks still need to consider various risks associated with crypto activities, including market and liquidity risks, operational and cybersecurity concerns, consumer protection requirements, and anti-money laundering obligations. The agency noted that institutions \"should engage with their supervisory team as appropriate\" when pursuing such activities.\n\nFriday's announcement comes as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to remove hurdles for digital assets. Besides the OCC’s actions, the government is pushing for a crypto reserve, and taking actions to boost the local crypto ecosystem.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency advocates welcomed the policy reversal, challenges remain for the industry—which, as consequence, means not everyone is excited with this regulatory shift. “Holy shit, the next Wall St. crash is going to make us long for the good ol' days of the Great Depression,” said Justin Rosario, host of the political podcast “The Opinionated Ogre.”\n\nOthers expressed concerns about the abruptness of the change. “FDIC announces robust new requirement to engage in crypto activities: you must pinky swear,” bank advisor and expert Donald F.

    "full_content": "# Nintendo Switch 2 Preview: Everything You Need to Know\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Mar 29, 2025\n\nThe Switch is Nintendo’s best-selling home console of all time, and widely beloved for its rich library of games—a dramatic turn from the middling Wii U before it. But it’s been eight years since the Switch launched, and fans are getting antsy for Nintendo’s next big thing.\n\nLuckily, it's coming. Following years of leaks and rumors, and even a couple official acknowledgments that the next-gen model was coming, Nintendo formally revealed the Switch 2 console in January 2025.\n\nFrom what we know officially and what's been widely reported, the Switch successor will pack in more power than the original while maintaining its winning blend of home console and handheld functionality. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nIt's official: Nintendo is making a successor to its wildly popular Switch console. Granted, that's no surprise to anyone that's followed the video game industry for more than a minute. But now we've seen what's coming.\n\nNintendo shared the first official teaser video below on January 16, 2025, sharing many key details for the Switch 2 while still playing coy on others. We've learned a lot from this video, no doubt, but there's still plenty we want to know.\n\nBut this isn't the first time that Nintendo has officially commented. On May 7, 2024, Nintendo's official corporate account tweeted the following statement:\n\n\"This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.\"\n\nThis is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct…\n\n— 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) May 7, 2024\n\nEven ahead of the May 2024 announcement, Nintendo was clearly planning for what’s next. In response to a fan question in June 2023, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said, “As for the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next-generation machine, we want to do as much as possible in order to smoothly transition our customers, while utilizing the Nintendo Account.”\n\nReports had long pointed to a late 2024 release target, but that didn't happen. Now, with the official trailer launch, all we have is a \"2025\" release window.\n\nWe can make some educated guesses here, however. Nintendo will hold a Direct livestream on April 2, 2025 at 9am ET to presumably share much more about the console, and then hold hands-on events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas throughout the rest of the month, with the last announced event ending on April 27.\n\nGo hands-on with #NintendoSwitch2 at Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas!\n\nA free Nintendo Account is required to register.\n\nFind out more: https://t.co/EECzR6hCk3 pic.twitter.com/Ky1NUaiDah\n\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) January 16, 2025\n\nNothing is official, but a June release target has been widely reported, including in a late March report from Insider Gaming citing retailer launch documents. Pre-orders are expected to begin either April 2, following the stream, or a week later on April 9.\n\nAny in-demand console launch is inevitably plagued by shortages, but Nintendo's president says the company is already thinking ahead to how to minimize the impact the next time around.\n\nIn an investor-centric Q&A from June 2024 translated from Japanese by IGN, Shuntaro Furukawa said that Nintendo is thinking ahead to supply issues and looking into how local laws and regulations could help stymie the resale market that many consoles get snapped up and sold into at inflated prices. Furthermore, the firm doesn't anticipate significant component shortages that could slow console manufacturing.\n\nIt’s been over four years since the release of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, a pair of game consoles that offer different performance and price options for players. But Microsoft is already thinking about the next big thing in Xbox land.\nUnsurprisingly, a next-generation Xbox is already in development, But what is surprising is that we’ve already heard official details on how Microsoft plans to position it, thanks to documents that were accidentally shared publicly in the FTC’s case again...\n\n“Although we were unable to produce sufficient quantities of Nintendo Switch hardware last year and the year before due to a shortage of semiconductor components, this situation has now been resolved,\" he said. \"At this time, we do not believe that the shortage of components will have a significant impact on the production of the successor model.\"\n\nIn February 2025, during the firm's latest earnings call, Furukawa reiterated that the company is aiming to discourage scalpers from buying up available stock for the resale market.\n\n“We will take all possible measures based on the experience we have accumulated to date (regarding scalpers and the like). We are making preparations,\" he said, per Nikkei (via VGC).\n\nEven with Nintendo's preparations, however, there's concern that launch supplies won't meet demand. The unnamed \"large U.S. retailer\" that provided documents to Insider Gaming is expecting a day-one pre-order sellout, for example.\n\nOfficially, we don't know yet: Nintendo hasn't said anything on this front. But there's been plenty of speculation.\n\nThe original Switch launched for $300 in 2017, with the purely handheld Switch Lite rolling out for $200 in 2019. With some premium enhancements (including a larger, bolder screen), the Nintendo Switch OLED model shipped for $350 in 2021.\n\nIn October 2023, a leaker—who WCCF Tech said has previously shared reliable information—claimed that the price point for the Switch 2 will be $449 for the base model and $400 for a version that is fully digital without cartridge support. The official Switch 2 trailer did not showcase or point to any fully digital model, however, so that may not actually be in the works.\n\nThe Switch 2 will launch into an increasingly competitive handheld landscape that includes many PC gaming devices. Valve's popular Steam Deck, for example, starts at $399 for the base model with an LCD screen, while more robust models with OLED panels start at $549.\n\nAfter a whole ton of speculation, much of which was right on-target, we can finally say: The Switch 2 looks like a bigger Switch, mostly.\n\nNintendo thankfully isn't ditching the Switch's smash-success hybrid design, delivering a handheld that can easily be docked for TV use. At its core, the Switch 2 doesn't change too much. But there are some notable tweaks and upgrades we're seeing from the trailer and official imagery so far.\n\nFirst off, the screen and Joy-Con attachment controllers are definitely larger. If we had to guess on screen size, we'd estimate somewhere around 7-8 inches, compared to 6.2 inches on the normal Switch. But Nintendo has yet to release official specs.\n\nThe model shown in the first trailer ditches the bold red and blue Joy-Con designs of the original launch model, instead going for a sleek black or perhaps dark gray scheme with red and blue accents under the analog sticks and in the connective tissue between the console (screen) unit and controllers.\n\nInstead of having these Joy-Con controllers slide into place, they'll plug in via an adapter port and be held in place with what appear to be magnets. There had been significant speculation that the Switch 2 will use electromagnets to keep the controllers in place. We can also see from the trailer that there's a new release button on the back of each Joy-Con that triggers a small plunger to disconnect them from the unit.\n\nFurthermore, there appears to be a new sensor on the Switch 2 Joy-cons that lets them be used like a computer mouse on a flat surface, once plugged into the wrist strap attachments. This appears to confirm speculation regarding mouse-like functionality, enabling more advanced control schemes for games like shooters, strategy sims, and maybe even creative apps.\n\nNintendo even has the Joy-Cons scurrying around like little techie mice in the trailer. But the right Joy-Con appears to ditch the infrared camera found on the original model, which was barely used by many games anyway.\n\nOther interesting details from the trailer: The new kickstand is much larger and hopefully sturdier than that of the original Switch, allowing for more freestanding positions. Also, there are now two USB-C ports—one on top and one on the bottom. Is the extra one meant to enable potentially new accessories?\n\nIn an updated render shared by Nintendo in late March, the small button at the bottom of the face of the right Joy-con controller now has a \"C\" emblazoned on it. Will it be a \"Cast\" button for streaming, or is it something else entirely? We should find out next week.\n\nAnd we know that the Switch 2 will continue to use the same physical cartridges from the Switch—yes, enabling backwards compatability—along with downloadable games.\n\nNintendo hasn't shared official specs yet, and the one game from the trailer didn't give a great sense of a visual upgrade. But we certainly expect a notable step up from what the original Switch could handle.\n\nReports suggest that Nintendo will not try to compete with the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X as the standard-bearers for home consoles and instead deliver a gaming experience with a bit less fidelity. That's been the standard Nintendo approach for a few generations now. Even so, it sounds like a significant improvement over the Switch.\n\nIn September 2023, leaked documents from major game publisher Activision showed that the company had evaluated the hardware in late 2022, ultimately surmising that the Switch successor will have similar power to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hardware.\n\nSingapore, Singapore, December 25th, 2024, Chainwire\n\nWith the Christmas season approaching, HTX has launched the 3rd phase of its limited-time \"Borrow & Earn\" event to thank the users for their support and trust. The event kicked off at 02:00 (UTC) on December 23, with the prize pool doubled to 10,800,000,000 $HTX (double the amount of the prize pool in the 2nd phase).\nExperiencing HTX Crypto Loans and Sharing in a Prize Pool for a Limited Time\nHTX's Flexible Crypto Loans product continues to d...\n\nWhile those are 10-year-old home consoles, it still would be a notable step up from what the original Switch can handle. The Switch’s hybrid home-plus-handheld model also means that Nintendo has to keep in mind a slim form factor and battery life expectations, so it’s unlikely that we’d even see a Switch-like device with top-end internals at a reasonable price.\n\nEurogamer reported that Nintendo showed off private tech demos for the Switch 2 to developers at the Gamescom conference in August 2023, and that it used an upgraded version of 2017’s hit The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a demonstration of the new hardware’s capabilities.\n\nVGC supported that report and added that Nintendo also used Epic Games’ The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5, with capabilities like ray tracing (realistic lighting effects) and AI-driven visual upscaling tricks enabled. Another rumor points to the use of \"ray reconstruction,\" a less hardware-intensive way of delivering ray tracing effects with the help of AI, via Nvidia's DLSS 3.5 tech.\n\nAll told, this may point to hardware that is actually more capable than the PS4 or Xbox One, even if it doesn’t quite match the benchmarks of the current-gen PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It could be relatively well equipped in terms of RAM, however, with noted leaker Felipe Lima suggesting that the device with have 12GB onboard—that's more than the Xbox Series S console at 10GB.\n\nWhile many of the most popular games this year demand spaceship-level tech or are out of reach due to costs, you don't need a GeForce RTX 4090 to play a handful of this year's memorable experiences via the Steam store.\nFor once, we're not suggesting you throw your wallet into a fire as a sacrifice to the Mighty Retail Lords. \nIn fact, you could get every title on this list for the cost of a little more than two full-price retail games. Let's look at the best games of 2024 under $25.\nEditor's not...\n\nA February 2024 report from Reuters cites a source claiming that the Switch 2 will use a custom Nvidia chip, much like the original Switch hardware did.\n\nAccording to a January 2024 report from Bloomberg, Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase says that Nintendo has picked a sizable 8-inch display for the Switch 2, and the display will use LCD tech as other reports have previously noted. Nintendo declined comment. The current Switch OLED model has a 7-inch screen, so this would be larger than any original Switch device.\n\nMobapad also points to an 8-inch display, which it says it be upgraded from 720p HD resolution on the original Switch to 1080p Full HD resolution on the successor.\n\nWe know one for sure: a new Mario Kart, revealed in the Switch 2 trailer. We don't have an official name yet; Mario Kart 9 would make sense based on the series' mainline entries, though earlier rumors pointed to a name of Mario Kart X to account for the mobile game Mario Kart Tour launching since Mario Kart 8 on Wii U (and later Switch).\n\nWhatever the final name, the new Mario Kart looks much like what we've come to expect from the series, though the brief tease appears to show 24 starting spots on the track—so there may be way more racers than usual.\n\nIt’s been over a decade since Grand Theft Auto 5 was released—but what will the sequel bring?\nThe massively popular open-world action franchise has sold over 430 million copies as of August 2024, putting it in the pantheon of the all-time best-selling game series. And that success has ignited widespread excitement over the next entry.\nNow Grand Theft Auto 6 has been officially revealed, and there’s plenty we already know from the first trailer and announcement, along with subsequent reveals. Her...\n\nYou can bet that we’ll see Nintendo’s tried-and-true franchises like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and many others in the mix before long, though Nintendo hasn't shown anything else besides Mario Kart just yet. Previous rumors have pointed to games like a new Donkey Kong or Ubisoft's next as-yet-unannounced Far Cry sequel, but those remain unconfirmed for now.\n\nThe long-delayed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still set to launch on the original Switch in 2025, Nintendo confirmed in February—but it's been widely rumored to also launch on Switch 2.\n\nIn fact, many gamers have suspected that the game's trailer is actually showing Switch 2 footage, but that hasn't been confirmed. But really, why wouldn't Nintendo release it across both consoles? There's precedent too: Nintendo launched The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the same date across Switch and Wii U, and Zelda: Twilight Princess just weeks apart across Wii and GameCube.\n\nElectronic Arts appears to be onboard with the Switch 2, and while that might sound obvious, EA hasn't put a new Madden NFL game on a Nintendo console since 2012. It's true: Madden never hit the Switch, and the company has been pretty selective with Nintendo games in the past.\n\n\"Any time a new console comes into the marketplace, that's of a benefit to us,\" EA CEO Andrew Wilson said during an earnings call in February 2025, per GameSpot. \"It gives us the ability to access and acquire new players. Typically, we've had franchises perform very well on Nintendo platforms. Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also planning to support the Switch 2 with Xbox games, as part of the firm's recent expansion to bring its owned franchises to other hardware. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January 2025 that he's \"really looking forward to supporting\" Nintendo's next console with games.\n\nAt first glance, the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn’t look all that different to the handheld console that it evolved from. A light recoloring, bigger screen, but what else? Anything… exciting? \nWell, eagle-eyed and conspiratorial thinkers have some ideas on what the two-minute trailer may have revealed without explicitly telling us. From an intriguing new Nintendo gimmick to possibly new Mario Kart mechanics, we’ve gathered four rising fan theories on what the Switch 2 has on offer for gamers.\n\n\nIntro...\n\nAfter Rockstar Games' official reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is currently announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, it begs the question: Will it come to Switch 2, too? And perhaps more pressingly, will the Switch 2 be powerful enough to run it?\n\nThere's no official word for now, of course, and there wouldn't be until Nintendo actually reveals its next console. But in the meantime, the technical experts at Digital Foundry are dubious that the Switch 2 will have enough power to handle Rockstar's next big game—at least based on the leaks so far.\n\n\"I’d love to say it would happen. I don’t think it will, realistically,\" said Digital Foundry founder Richard Leadbetter in a YouTube video (via IGN). \"It’s a mobile chipset. We’ve seen a lot of amazing things on the Switch 1. Switch 2 is going to be a lot better, a proper generational leap, and forward-looking in many ways. But the stuff they seem to be rolling out for GTA 6 is possibly beyond that.\"\n\n\"It seems a step beyond,\" he added, \"and out of character with what we know about Rockstar’s M.O.\"\n\nYes! Nintendo tweeted on November 5, 2024 that the \"successor to the Nintendo Switch\" will also be able to play original Switch software. This had been rumored and reported previously, but the gaming giant cleared up any questions about Switch owners making a graceful transition to the new device. The Switch Online service will also return on Switch 2.\n\nThis is Furukawa. At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about…\n\n— 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) November 6, 2024\n\nNintendo repeated the message in the January 2025 trailer, showing that Switch cartridges will fit into the Switch 2, and noting that digital games will also be supported. A physical copy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was shown in the trailer. However, there was a caveat: Some games may not be supported or work in full.\n\nWhat does that mean? While we don't know for sure yet, it's likely that some games designed for the size and shape of the original Joy-Cons—like fitness game Ring Fit Adventure, which had players snap their controllers into an accessory shell—simply won't work with the Switch 2 controllers. And the rare few games that used the IR camera on the original right Joy-Con, like 1-2 Switch, similarly will lose functionality on Switch 2 hardware.\n\nThe other lingering question about backwards compatibility is whether the Switch games will simply run as-is, or if they will take advantage of the Switch 2's expected performance bump—whether that's an automatic upgrade, or one that developers may need to code and patch in.\n\nA report from Eurogamer in February 2024 suggested that Nintendo will let users play their original Switch games (both physical and digital) in the Switch 2 hardware with enhancements. Developers will reportedly need to update their games to unlock such upgrades, however, which means not every game will necessarily take advantage of the Switch 2's improved power.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on September 19, 2023 and last updated on March 28, 2025.\n\n$82,860.00\n\n$1,815.33\n\n$2.15\n\n$604.89\n\n$124.97\n\n$0.999962\n\n$0.169051\n\n$0.671304\n\n$0.230469\n\n$1,814.32\n\n$82,689.00\n\n$3.80\n\n$9.68\n\n$13.61\n\n$0.268345\n\n$19.39\n\n$2,175.29\n\n$0.999826\n\n$2.35\n\n$0.00001259\n\n$0.170389\n\n$86.33\n\n$4.07\n\n$6.26\n\n$304.64\n\n$4.58\n\n$1,815.10\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.99962\n\n$0.761512\n\n$12.59\n\n$1,929.79\n\n$28.20\n\n$217.54\n\n$5.95\n\n$5.27\n\n$2.64\n\n$1.045\n\n$0.00000704\n\n$48.56\n\n$0.104188\n\n$34.33\n\n$22.27\n\n$0.802359\n\n$82,946.00\n\n$0.998835\n\n$5.36\n\n$16.69\n\n$0.797439\n\n$163.89\n\n$1.16\n\n$10.16\n\n$0.02282286\n\n$0.369889\n\n$227.57\n\n$1.00\n\n$3.30\n\n$4.30\n\n$3.52\n\n$2.76\n\n$0.203771\n\n$82,722.00\n\n$4.02\n\n$0.064582\n\n$0.182796\n\n$0.488968\n\n$0.332525\n\n$5.29\n\n$11.07\n\n$0.483234\n\n$82,709.00\n\n$0.473405\n\n$0.752755\n\n$1,886.99\n\n$1,814.91\n\n$1,280.43\n\n$1.076\n\n$0.433606\n\n$0.066644\n\n$129.96\n\n$69.64\n\n$17.61\n\n$0.548944\n\n$0.999783\n\n$0.784682\n\n$0.624082\n\n$0.602264\n\n$0.998001\n\n$2,052.08\n\n$0.00001133\n\n$0.177727\n\n$8.76\n\n$0.089513\n\n$0.826447\n\n$0.999641\n\n$0.01328979\n\n$0.999719\n\n$1.00\n\n$7.42\n\n$82,393.00\n\n$0.867729\n\n$3,107.30\n\n$1.00\n\n$605.25\n\n$1,927.13\n\n$2.20\n\n$0.01555277\n\n$3,133.63\n\n$0.654411\n\n$82,693.00\n\n$0.00000068\n\n$0.270839\n\n$0.172991\n\n$31.97\n\n$0.999106\n\n$0.476797\n\n$159.91\n\n$0.103061\n\n$2.00\n\n$0.382061\n\n$36.28\n\n$3.20\n\n$0.00005815\n\n$1,891.31\n\n$7.47\n\n$0.148065\n\n$0.01108093\n\n$15.95\n\n$0.999679\n\n$136.92\n\n$0.075827\n\n$1.73\n\n$0.398003\n\n$0.998709\n\n$0.645402\n\n$1.73\n\n$0.998922\n\n$81,775.00\n\n$2.95\n\n$0.47017\n\n$0.999904\n\n$0.00505739\n\n$16.46\n\n$0.424443\n\n$0.245437\n\n$27.86\n\n$0.707538\n\n$0.434816\n\n$0.168946\n\n$0.432312\n\n$1,925.63\n\n$6.51\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$82,712.00\n\n$5.98\n\n$0.451176\n\n$1,815.82\n\n$0.152114\n\n$82,719.00\n\n$1.082\n\n$1.00\n\n$2.51\n\n$0.080316\n\n$0.617365\n\n$0.04213324\n\n$1.13\n\n$1,815.51\n\n$0.00002002\n\n$1,814.80\n\n$110.49\n\n$0.00745054\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.473538\n\n$0.469051\n\n$0.00593968\n\n$1,893.87\n\n$82,470.00\n\n$0.00645664\n\n$0.203985\n\n$0.86757\n\n$0.373948\n\n$0.999251\n\n$38.90\n\n$0.174365\n\n$0.999639\n\n$0.999382\n\n$0.01031925\n\n$82,267.00\n\n$0.00393955\n\n$0.00000161\n\n$1,813.75\n\n$0.00005983\n\n$1,823.26\n\n$1.001\n\n$1.50\n\n$2.81\n\n$119.01\n\n$0.00050941\n\n$0.55082\n\n$0.03075538\n\n$0.03049937\n\n$1.22\n\n$0.244249\n\n$0.250856\n\n$1.24\n\n$1,797.21\n\n$3.66\n\n$1,815.93\n\n$0.640455\n\n$2.86\n\n$82,588.00\n\n$82,691.00\n\n$21.85\n\n$0.773567\n\n$0.190559\n\n$15.93\n\n$3,083.75\n\n$0.259439\n\n$1.07\n\n$1,985.48\n\n$1,914.37\n\n$0.998916\n\n$0.49984\n\n$0.067282\n\n$0.084425\n\n$0.03566163\n\n$0.0027202\n\n$0.03035925\n\n$1,971.98\n\n$0.116344\n\n$0.104279\n\n$0.0031768\n\n$0.00228345\n\n$0.945501\n\n$0.510541\n\n$1,663.69\n\n$0.03021531\n\n$1,813.49\n\n$0.00482748\n\n$0.529217\n\n$0.0112212\n\n$20.01\n\n$2.18\n\n$0.645622\n\n$2.16\n\n$0.214082\n\n$0.999668\n\n$0.294472\n\nIt’s been over four years since the release of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, a pair of game consoles that offer different performance and price options for players.

But it’s been eight years since the Switch launched, and fans are getting antsy for Nintendo’s next big thing.\n\nLuckily, it's coming. Following years of leaks and rumors, and even a couple official acknowledgments that the next-gen model was coming, Nintendo formally revealed the Switch 2 console in January 2025.\n\nFrom what we know officially and what's been widely reported, the Switch successor will pack in more power than the original while maintaining its winning blend of home console and handheld functionality. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nIt's official: Nintendo is making a successor to its wildly popular Switch console. Granted, that's no surprise to anyone that's followed the video game industry for more than a minute. But now we've seen what's coming.\n\nNintendo shared the first official teaser video below on January 16, 2025, sharing many key details for the Switch 2 while still playing coy on others. We've learned a lot from this video, no doubt, but there's still plenty we want to know.\n\nBut this isn't the first time that Nintendo has officially commented. On May 7, 2024, Nintendo's official corporate account tweeted the following statement:\n\n\"This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.\"\n\nThis is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct…\n\n— 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) May 7, 2024\n\nEven ahead of the May 2024 announcement, Nintendo was clearly planning for what’s next. In response to a fan question in June 2023, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said, “As for the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next-generation machine, we want to do as much as possible in order to smoothly transition our customers, while utilizing the Nintendo Account.”\n\nReports had long pointed to a late 2024 release target, but that didn't happen. Now, with the official trailer launch, all we have is a \"2025\" release window.\n\nWe can make some educated guesses here, however. Nintendo will hold a Direct livestream on April 2, 2025 at 9am ET to presumably share much more about the console, and then hold hands-on events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas throughout the rest of the month, with the last announced event ending on April 27.\n\nGo hands-on with #NintendoSwitch2 at Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas!\n\nA free Nintendo Account is required to register.\n\nFind out more: https://t.co/EECzR6hCk3 pic.twitter.com/Ky1NUaiDah\n\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) January 16, 2025\n\nNothing is official, but a June release target has been widely reported, including in a late March report from Insider Gaming citing retailer launch documents. Pre-orders are expected to begin either April 2, following the stream, or a week later on April 9.\n\nAny in-demand console launch is inevitably plagued by shortages, but Nintendo's president says the company is already thinking ahead to how to minimize the impact the next time around.\n\nIn an investor-centric Q&A from June 2024 translated from Japanese by IGN, Shuntaro Furukawa said that Nintendo is thinking ahead to supply issues and looking into how local laws and regulations could help stymie the resale market that many consoles get snapped up and sold into at inflated prices. Furthermore, the firm doesn't anticipate significant component shortages that could slow console manufacturing.\n\nIt’s been over four years since the release of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, a pair of game consoles that offer different performance and price options for players. But Microsoft is already thinking about the next big thing in Xbox land.\nUnsurprisingly, a next-generation Xbox is already in development, But what is surprising is that we’ve already heard official details on how Microsoft plans to position it, thanks to documents that were accidentally shared publicly in the FTC’s case again...\n\n“Although we were unable to produce sufficient quantities of Nintendo Switch hardware last year and the year before due to a shortage of semiconductor components, this situation has now been resolved,\" he said. \"At this time, we do not believe that the shortage of components will have a significant impact on the production of the successor model.\"\n\nIn February 2025, during the firm's latest earnings call, Furukawa reiterated that the company is aiming to discourage scalpers from buying up available stock for the resale market.\n\n“We will take all possible measures based on the experience we have accumulated to date (regarding scalpers and the like). We are making preparations,\" he said, per Nikkei (via VGC).\n\nEven with Nintendo's preparations, however, there's concern that launch supplies won't meet demand. The unnamed \"large U.S. retailer\" that provided documents to Insider Gaming is expecting a day-one pre-order sellout, for example.\n\nOfficially, we don't know yet: Nintendo hasn't said anything on this front. But there's been plenty of speculation.\n\nThe original Switch launched for $300 in 2017, with the purely handheld Switch Lite rolling out for $200 in 2019. With some premium enhancements (including a larger, bolder screen), the Nintendo Switch OLED model shipped for $350 in 2021.\n\nIn October 2023, a leaker—who WCCF Tech said has previously shared reliable information—claimed that the price point for the Switch 2 will be $449 for the base model and $400 for a version that is fully digital without cartridge support. The official Switch 2 trailer did not showcase or point to any fully digital model, however, so that may not actually be in the works.\n\nThe Switch 2 will launch into an increasingly competitive handheld landscape that includes many PC gaming devices. Valve's popular Steam Deck, for example, starts at $399 for the base model with an LCD screen, while more robust models with OLED panels start at $549.\n\nAfter a whole ton of speculation, much of which was right on-target, we can finally say: The Switch 2 looks like a bigger Switch, mostly.\n\nNintendo thankfully isn't ditching the Switch's smash-success hybrid design, delivering a handheld that can easily be docked for TV use. At its core, the Switch 2 doesn't change too much. But there are some notable tweaks and upgrades we're seeing from the trailer and official imagery so far.\n\nFirst off, the screen and Joy-Con attachment controllers are definitely larger. If we had to guess on screen size, we'd estimate somewhere around 7-8 inches, compared to 6.2 inches on the normal Switch. But Nintendo has yet to release official specs.\n\nThe model shown in the first trailer ditches the bold red and blue Joy-Con designs of the original launch model, instead going for a sleek black or perhaps dark gray scheme with red and blue accents under the analog sticks and in the connective tissue between the console (screen) unit and controllers.\n\nInstead of having these Joy-Con controllers slide into place, they'll plug in via an adapter port and be held in place with what appear to be magnets. There had been significant speculation that the Switch 2 will use electromagnets to keep the controllers in place. We can also see from the trailer that there's a new release button on the back of each Joy-Con that triggers a small plunger to disconnect them from the unit.\n\nFurthermore, there appears to be a new sensor on the Switch 2 Joy-cons that lets them be used like a computer mouse on a flat surface, once plugged into the wrist strap attachments. This appears to confirm speculation regarding mouse-like functionality, enabling more advanced control schemes for games like shooters, strategy sims, and maybe even creative apps.\n\nNintendo even has the Joy-Cons scurrying around like little techie mice in the trailer. But the right Joy-Con appears to ditch the infrared camera found on the original model, which was barely used by many games anyway.\n\nOther interesting details from the trailer: The new kickstand is much larger and hopefully sturdier than that of the original Switch, allowing for more freestanding positions. Also, there are now two USB-C ports—one on top and one on the bottom. Is the extra one meant to enable potentially new accessories?\n\nIn an updated render shared by Nintendo in late March, the small button at the bottom of the face of the right Joy-con controller now has a \"C\" emblazoned on it. Will it be a \"Cast\" button for streaming, or is it something else entirely? We should find out next week.\n\nAnd we know that the Switch 2 will continue to use the same physical cartridges from the Switch—yes, enabling backwards compatability—along with downloadable games.\n\nNintendo hasn't shared official specs yet, and the one game from the trailer didn't give a great sense of a visual upgrade. But we certainly expect a notable step up from what the original Switch could handle.\n\nReports suggest that Nintendo will not try to compete with the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X as the standard-bearers for home consoles and instead deliver a gaming experience with a bit less fidelity. That's been the standard Nintendo approach for a few generations now. Even so, it sounds like a significant improvement over the Switch.\n\nIn September 2023, leaked documents from major game publisher Activision showed that the company had evaluated the hardware in late 2022, ultimately surmising that the Switch successor will have similar power to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hardware.\n\nSingapore, Singapore, December 25th, 2024, Chainwire\n\nWith the Christmas season approaching, HTX has launched the 3rd phase of its limited-time \"Borrow & Earn\" event to thank the users for their support and trust. The event kicked off at 02:00 (UTC) on December 23, with the prize pool doubled to 10,800,000,000 $HTX (double the amount of the prize pool in the 2nd phase).\nExperiencing HTX Crypto Loans and Sharing in a Prize Pool for a Limited Time\nHTX's Flexible Crypto Loans product continues to d...\n\nWhile those are 10-year-old home consoles, it still would be a notable step up from what the original Switch can handle. The Switch’s hybrid home-plus-handheld model also means that Nintendo has to keep in mind a slim form factor and battery life expectations, so it’s unlikely that we’d even see a Switch-like device with top-end internals at a reasonable price.\n\nEurogamer reported that Nintendo showed off private tech demos for the Switch 2 to developers at the Gamescom conference in August 2023, and that it used an upgraded version of 2017’s hit The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a demonstration of the new hardware’s capabilities.\n\nVGC supported that report and added that Nintendo also used Epic Games’ The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5, with capabilities like ray tracing (realistic lighting effects) and AI-driven visual upscaling tricks enabled. Another rumor points to the use of \"ray reconstruction,\" a less hardware-intensive way of delivering ray tracing effects with the help of AI, via Nvidia's DLSS 3.5 tech.\n\nAll told, this may point to hardware that is actually more capable than the PS4 or Xbox One, even if it doesn’t quite match the benchmarks of the current-gen PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It could be relatively well equipped in terms of RAM, however, with noted leaker Felipe Lima suggesting that the device with have 12GB onboard—that's more than the Xbox Series S console at 10GB.\n\nWhile many of the most popular games this year demand spaceship-level tech or are out of reach due to costs, you don't need a GeForce RTX 4090 to play a handful of this year's memorable experiences via the Steam store.\nFor once, we're not suggesting you throw your wallet into a fire as a sacrifice to the Mighty Retail Lords. \nIn fact, you could get every title on this list for the cost of a little more than two full-price retail games. Let's look at the best games of 2024 under $25.\nEditor's not...\n\nA February 2024 report from Reuters cites a source claiming that the Switch 2 will use a custom Nvidia chip, much like the original Switch hardware did.\n\nAccording to a January 2024 report from Bloomberg, Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase says that Nintendo has picked a sizable 8-inch display for the Switch 2, and the display will use LCD tech as other reports have previously noted. Nintendo declined comment. The current Switch OLED model has a 7-inch screen, so this would be larger than any original Switch device.\n\nMobapad also points to an 8-inch display, which it says it be upgraded from 720p HD resolution on the original Switch to 1080p Full HD resolution on the successor.\n\nWe know one for sure: a new Mario Kart, revealed in the Switch 2 trailer. We don't have an official name yet; Mario Kart 9 would make sense based on the series' mainline entries, though earlier rumors pointed to a name of Mario Kart X to account for the mobile game Mario Kart Tour launching since Mario Kart 8 on Wii U (and later Switch).\n\nWhatever the final name, the new Mario Kart looks much like what we've come to expect from the series, though the brief tease appears to show 24 starting spots on the track—so there may be way more racers than usual.\n\nIt’s been over a decade since Grand Theft Auto 5 was released—but what will the sequel bring?\nThe massively popular open-world action franchise has sold over 430 million copies as of August 2024, putting it in the pantheon of the all-time best-selling game series. And that success has ignited widespread excitement over the next entry.\nNow Grand Theft Auto 6 has been officially revealed, and there’s plenty we already know from the first trailer and announcement, along with subsequent reveals. Her...\n\nYou can bet that we’ll see Nintendo’s tried-and-true franchises like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and many others in the mix before long, though Nintendo hasn't shown anything else besides Mario Kart just yet. Previous rumors have pointed to games like a new Donkey Kong or Ubisoft's next as-yet-unannounced Far Cry sequel, but those remain unconfirmed for now.\n\nThe long-delayed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still set to launch on the original Switch in 2025, Nintendo confirmed in February—but it's been widely rumored to also launch on Switch 2.\n\nIn fact, many gamers have suspected that the game's trailer is actually showing Switch 2 footage, but that hasn't been confirmed. But really, why wouldn't Nintendo release it across both consoles? There's precedent too: Nintendo launched The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the same date across Switch and Wii U, and Zelda: Twilight Princess just weeks apart across Wii and GameCube.\n\nElectronic Arts appears to be onboard with the Switch 2, and while that might sound obvious, EA hasn't put a new Madden NFL game on a Nintendo console since 2012. It's true: Madden never hit the Switch, and the company has been pretty selective with Nintendo games in the past.\n\n\"Any time a new console comes into the marketplace, that's of a benefit to us,\" EA CEO Andrew Wilson said during an earnings call in February 2025, per GameSpot. \"It gives us the ability to access and acquire new players. Typically, we've had franchises perform very well on Nintendo platforms. Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also planning to support the Switch 2 with Xbox games, as part of the firm's recent expansion to bring its owned franchises to other hardware. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January 2025 that he's \"really looking forward to supporting\" Nintendo's next console with games.\n\nAt first glance, the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn’t look all that different to the handheld console that it evolved from. A light recoloring, bigger screen, but what else? Anything… exciting? \nWell, eagle-eyed and conspiratorial thinkers have some ideas on what the two-minute trailer may have revealed without explicitly telling us. From an intriguing new Nintendo gimmick to possibly new Mario Kart mechanics, we’ve gathered four rising fan theories on what the Switch 2 has on offer for gamers.\n\n\nIntro...\n\nAfter Rockstar Games' official reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is currently announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, it begs the question: Will it come to Switch 2, too? And perhaps more pressingly, will the Switch 2 be powerful enough to run it?\n\nThere's no official word for now, of course, and there wouldn't be until Nintendo actually reveals its next console. But in the meantime, the technical experts at Digital Foundry are dubious that the Switch 2 will have enough power to handle Rockstar's next big game—at least based on the leaks so far.\n\n\"I’d love to say it would happen. I don’t think it will, realistically,\" said Digital Foundry founder Richard Leadbetter in a YouTube video (via IGN). \"It’s a mobile chipset. We’ve seen a lot of amazing things on the Switch 1. Switch 2 is going to be a lot better, a proper generational leap, and forward-looking in many ways. But the stuff they seem to be rolling out for GTA 6 is possibly beyond that.\"\n\n\"It seems a step beyond,\" he added, \"and out of character with what we know about Rockstar’s M.O.\"\n\nYes! Nintendo tweeted on November 5, 2024 that the \"successor to the Nintendo Switch\" will also be able to play original Switch software. This had been rumored and reported previously, but the gaming giant cleared up any questions about Switch owners making a graceful transition to the new device. The Switch Online service will also return on Switch 2.\n\nThis is Furukawa. At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well.

A physical copy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was shown in the trailer. However, there was a caveat: Some games may not be supported or work in full.\n\nWhat does that mean? While we don't know for sure yet, it's likely that some games designed for the size and shape of the original Joy-Cons—like fitness game Ring Fit Adventure, which had players snap their controllers into an accessory shell—simply won't work with the Switch 2 controllers. And the rare few games that used the IR camera on the original right Joy-Con, like 1-2 Switch, similarly will lose functionality on Switch 2 hardware.\n\nThe other lingering question about backwards compatibility is whether the Switch games will simply run as-is, or if they will take advantage of the Switch 2's expected performance bump—whether that's an automatic upgrade, or one that developers may need to code and patch in.\n\nA report from Eurogamer in February 2024 suggested that Nintendo will let users play their original Switch games (both physical and digital) in the Switch 2 hardware with enhancements. Developers will reportedly need to update their games to unlock such upgrades, however, which means not every game will necessarily take advantage of the Switch 2's improved power.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on September 19, 2023 and last updated on March 28, 2025.\n\nIt’s been over four years since the release of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, a pair of game consoles that offer different performance and price options for players.
