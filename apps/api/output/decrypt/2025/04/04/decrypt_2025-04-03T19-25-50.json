    "full_content": "# Nintendo Switch 2 Preview: Release Date, Price and Launch Games\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 4, 2025\n\nThe Switch is Nintendo’s best-selling home console of all time, and widely beloved for its rich library of games—a dramatic turn from the middling Wii U before it. But it’s been eight years since the Switch launched, and fans are getting antsy for Nintendo’s next big thing.\n\nLuckily, it's coming. Following years of leaks and rumors, and even a couple official acknowledgments that the next-gen model was coming, Nintendo formally revealed the Switch 2 console in January 2025—and now we know when we'll be able to buy it and for how much.\n\nFrom what we know officially and what's been widely reported, the Switch successor will pack in more power than the original while maintaining its winning blend of home console and handheld functionality. Here's everything you need to know about the hardware, launch games, and more.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 will release on June 5, with pre-orders beginning on April 9.\n\nNintendo will hold hands-on events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas throughout the rest of the month, with the last announced event ending on April 27.\n\nAny in-demand console launch is inevitably plagued by shortages, but Nintendo's president has been saying for almost a year now that the company is thinking ahead to how to minimize the impact for the Switch 2 launch. In February 2025, during the firm's latest earnings call, Furukawa reiterated that the company is aiming to discourage scalpers from buying up available stock for the resale market.\n\n“We will take all possible measures based on the experience we have accumulated to date (regarding scalpers and the like). We are making preparations,\" he said, per Nikkei (via VGC).\n\nNintendo is allowing Switch Online subscribers with at least 50 hours of logged gameplay to register their interest ahead of pre-orders opening on April 9. This is one way that Nintendo may funnel actual players towards purchases, rather than allowing scalpers to buy up launch hardware en masse.\n\nThe Switch 2 will launch in the U.S. at a price of $450 for the base console, or $500 for a bundle that includes a download code for launch title Mario Kart World.\n\nThe original Switch launched for $300 in 2017, with the purely handheld Switch Lite rolling out for $200 in 2019. With some premium enhancements (including a larger, bolder screen), the Nintendo Switch OLED model shipped for $350 in 2021.\n\nThe Switch 2 will release into an increasingly competitive handheld landscape that includes many PC gaming devices. Valve's popular Steam Deck, for example, starts at $400 for the base model with an LCD screen, while more robust models with OLED panels start at $550.\n\nNintendo shared its launch plans for the Switch 2 console in a long-awaited livestream Wednesday, announcing that the successor to the massively popular convertible game device will release in June.\nThe Switch 2 will hit North American retailers on June 5 and sell for $450 on its own, or $500 with a download code for Mario Kart World included. The base model is $150 more than the original Switch's launch price.\nNintendo also shared some details about what new hardware features mean for the Switc...\n\nSwitch 2 games will be pricey, however. Mario Kart World will sell for $80 for a digital copy, with international pricing suggesting that physical versions could go for $90. Donkey Kong Bananza, meanwhile, will sell for $70.\n\nMario Kart World's pricing has been a source of controversy among gamers, as it beats the typical $60 price of most major Switch games, or $70 for larger PS5 and Xbox Series X/S games. However, amid speculation that the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 could sell for as much as $100, it's likely to be the start of a growing trend for major releases.\n\nIt’s been over a decade since Grand Theft Auto 5 was released—but what will the sequel bring?\nThe massively popular open-world action franchise has sold over 430 million copies as of August 2024, putting it in the pantheon of the all-time best-selling game series. And that success has ignited widespread excitement over the next entry.\nNow Grand Theft Auto 6 has been officially revealed, and there’s plenty we already know from the first trailer and announcement, along with subsequent reveals. Her...\n\nAfter a whole ton of speculation, much of which was right on-target, we can finally say: The Switch 2 looks like a bigger Switch, mostly.\n\nNintendo thankfully isn't ditching the Switch's smash-success hybrid design, delivering a handheld that can easily be docked for TV use. At its core, the Switch 2 doesn't change too much. But there are some notable tweaks and upgrades we're seeing from the trailer and official imagery so far.\n\nFirst off, the screen and Joy-Con attachment controllers are definitely larger. The screen will be 7.9 inches in size, compared to 6.2 inches on the normal Switch, plus the LCD panel is a crisper 1080p screen with support for HDR and 120 frames per second. When plugged into the new dock, you'll be able to get 4K resolution on a compatible TV—though only at 60fps.\n\nThe model shown ditches the bold red and blue Joy-Con designs of the original launch model, instead going for a sleek black or perhaps dark gray scheme with red and blue accents under the analog sticks and in the connective tissue between the console (screen) unit and controllers.\n\nInstead of having these Joy-Con controllers slide into place, they'll plug in via an adapter port and be held in place with magnets. There's a new release button on the back of each Joy-Con that triggers a small plunger to disconnect them from the unit.\n\nFurthermore, there's new sensor on the Switch 2 Joy-cons that lets them be used like a computer mouse on a flat surface, once plugged into the wrist strap attachments.\n\nThis confirms speculation regarding mouse-like functionality, enabling more advanced control schemes for games like shooters, strategy sims, and maybe even creative apps. Nintendo even showed the Joy-Cons scurrying around like little techie mice in the teaser trailer.\n\nThe new kickstand is also much larger and hopefully sturdier than that of the original Switch, allowing for more freestanding positions. Also, there are now two USB-C ports—one on top and one on the bottom. Either can be used to charge the system, depending on how you're using it, while the other port will enable wired accessories—like USB cameras for the new GameChat streaming feature. GameChat is accessed via the new C button on the right Joy-Con.\n\nAnd we know that the Switch 2 will continue to use the same physical cartridges from the Switch—yes, enabling backwards compatibility—along with downloadable games. Most Switch games will be playable on Switch 2, though there are some that won't work with the new controllers or that had issues during testing.\n\nNintendo still hasn't shared official specs, as of this writing. The system runs a custom Nvidia processor, and while it's definitely more powerful than the original Switch—given not only the 1080p/120fps and 4K TV compatibility, but also the visually upgraded versions of hit Switch games—we don't yet have numbers to point to.\n\nThe Switch 2 will have 256GB of built-in, high-speed storage—that's eight times the local storage from the Switch. And the new console will support microSD Express cards for expandable storage, but not standard microSD cards. Switch 2 buyers will be able to use a transfer feature to move data from an older console.\n\nBattery life for the Switch 2 is estimated between 2-6.5 hours, depending on how you're using the console. On the low end, that's a step down from the standard Switch, but it's in the same ballpark as the Steam Deck.\n\nThe Switch 2 launch will be led by Mario Kart World, which was teased in the original Switch 2 trailer in January. The new Mario Kart looks much like what we've come to expect from the series, but with some ambitious new features.\n\nDrive virtually everywhere in Mario Kart World, a brand-new Mario Kart game releasing exclusively on #NintendoSwitch2 as a launch title! #NintendoDirect pic.twitter.com/zvN4C6l3ft\n\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) April 2, 2025\n\nFor example, all of the tracks are part of an interconnected world, and you'll even drive between the track locations between races. This also opens the door to a free-roam mode that lets you cruise the terrain, either solo or with pals, plus the tracks themselves look larger in scale and support up to 24 simultaneous racers.\n\nAnother major game, Donkey Kong Bananza, is a 3D platform-action game that looks very similar in vibe to the critically acclaimed Super Mario Odyssey from Switch. That one's due out on July 17. Nintendo teased future Switch 2 games like the Zelda action spinoff Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment and racing game Kirby's Air Riders.\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza, a brand-new 3D platforming action adventure is coming exclusively to #NintendoSwitch2 on July 17! #NintendoDirect pic.twitter.com/79mWd3gDja\n\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) April 2, 2025\n\nA pair of games that were previously announced for the original Switch—Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokémon Legends: Z-A—will indeed launch across both systems, each packing an array of visual enhancements on the Switch 2.\n\nNumerous third-party games have also been announced for the Switch 2, including Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades 2, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Street Fighter 6, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, Hitman: World of Assassination, Borderlands 4, and upgraded versions of Sid Meier's Civilization 7 and Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nFrom Software is also bringing an exclusive multiplayer game called The Duskbloods to Switch 2, and fans of the Dark Souls studio have said it gives a similar vibe as From's PS4 favorite Bloodborne.\n\nAnd along with some of the retro games already playable on Switch for Switch Online subscribers, the Switch 2 will add games from the Nintendo GameCube console. Initial games include The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2, and F-Zero GX, with multiplayer games playable online. Nintendo will also sell a Switch 2-compatible wireless GameCube controller.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, most original Switch games will be playable, though there are exceptions. On top of that, Nintendo will also offer upgraded versions of major Switch titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and sequel Tears of the Kingdom, both of which will pack visual enhancements such as crisper graphics and a smoother frame rate.\n\nNintendo will sell these enhanced versions as standalone games, but also offer paid upgrades for players who own the Switch originals. Other Switch games that are set to get enhancements include Super Mario Party: Jamboree and Kirby and the Forgotten Land.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on September 19, 2023 and last updated on April 3, 2025.\n\n$81,937.00\n\n$1,785.29\n\n$2.05\n\n$587.69\n\n$0.999884\n\n$115.19\n\n$0.158798\n\n$0.638905\n\n$0.235905\n\n$1,784.94\n\n$81,937.00\n\n$3.58\n\n$9.38\n\n$12.64\n\n$0.999961\n\n$0.25766\n\n$2,138.48\n\n$18.07\n\n$2.23\n\n$0.00001219\n\n$0.160526\n\n$82.21\n\n$6.40\n\n$4.03\n\n$294.95\n\n$4.46\n\n$0.999454\n\n$1.002\n\n$1,784.86\n\n$1,898.48\n\n$27.55\n\n$0.580355\n\n$209.63\n\n$11.30\n\n$5.74\n\n$5.01\n\n$1.046\n\n$2.46\n\n$0.00000658\n\n$45.95\n\n$81,902.00\n\n$33.32\n\n$21.53\n\n$0.094647\n\n$0.79344\n\n$0.741957\n\n$5.09\n\n$15.97\n\n$0.993736\n\n$1.16\n\n$150.30\n\n$4.52\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.02157484\n\n$9.06\n\n$208.20\n\n$2.69\n\n$81,734.00\n\n$4.04\n\n$3.25\n\n$0.063663\n\n$0.307668\n\n$0.18713\n\n$2.72\n\n$0.175487\n\n$0.465348\n\n$0.303991\n\n$10.36\n\n$81,670.00\n\n$0.822144\n\n$0.428664\n\n$0.683501\n\n$4.23\n\n$1,789.79\n\n$0.380755\n\n$1,248.09\n\n$1,858.03\n\n$1.046\n\n$0.065029\n\n$68.15\n\n$1.001\n\n$120.04\n\n$0.379052\n\n$0.748372\n\n$2,020.11\n\n$0.57582\n\n$15.24\n\n$0.997692\n\n$1.003\n\n$0.00001092\n\n$0.465496\n\n$0.999098\n\n$8.33\n\n$0.01299492\n\n$0.162258\n\n$0.081957\n\n$0.780478\n\n$3,123.42\n\n$0.999511\n\n$81,784.00\n\n$0.809753\n\n$589.51\n\n$1,896.08\n\n$3,126.82\n\n$0.522903\n\n$0.535232\n\n$0.643191\n\n$81,945.00\n\n$0.01470706\n\n$5.94\n\n$0.259442\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.00000063\n\n$38.24\n\n$1.96\n\n$0.103711\n\n$30.10\n\n$0.16089\n\n$0.363751\n\n$147.47\n\n$0.997975\n\n$1,860.24\n\n$1.81\n\n$0.999255\n\n$1.81\n\n$0.00005431\n\n$2.78\n\n$0.996899\n\n$14.85\n\n$126.97\n\n$0.00996623\n\n$0.068835\n\n$0.130982\n\n$0.609815\n\n$0.999748\n\n$0.999676\n\n$2.88\n\n$80,308.00\n\n$6.00\n\n$1.65\n\n$1.00\n\n$27.32\n\n$0.23829\n\n$0.440659\n\n$0.407018\n\n$2.69\n\n$0.00464786\n\n$1,895.46\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$15.02\n\n$46.89\n\n$81,977.00\n\n$83,010.00\n\n$0.664727\n\n$0.159152\n\n$0.997917\n\n$110.54\n\n$1,784.05\n\n$0.429831\n\n$1,786.63\n\n$0.078248\n\n$1.047\n\n$0.086869\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.133203\n\n$1,785.12\n\n$0.04050249\n\n$0.38414\n\n$0.0000194\n\n$1.089\n\n$5.72\n\n$0.374861\n\n$81,756.00\n\n$1,863.37\n\n$0.00635799\n\n$0.178085\n\n$0.546306\n\n$0.43744\n\n$0.998855\n\n$0.131485\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.816016\n\n$0.00644345\n\n$0.187994\n\n$4.65\n\n$1,784.95\n\n$1.003\n\n$0.339411\n\n$1,785.19\n\n$0.00000155\n\n$0.00005788\n\n$0.390015\n\n$0.03114433\n\n$1.43\n\n$115.73\n\n$0.00476545\n\n$2.68\n\n$0.999242\n\n$0.518295\n\n$0.02964793\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.00883042\n\n$0.00346828\n\n$1,760.21\n\n$81,629.00\n\n$1.13\n\n$0.225057\n\n$1,785.18\n\n$2.83\n\n$81,784.00\n\n$1.11\n\n$0.524089\n\n$3,108.36\n\n$0.592012\n\n$0.222661\n\n$21.23\n\n$1,883.68\n\n$0.183035\n\n$1,954.57\n\n$0.00273893\n\n$14.93\n\n$3.10\n\n$0.116556\n\n$1,943.03\n\n$0.0296072\n\n$21.10\n\n$0.231248\n\n$1,644.08\n\n$0.099695\n\n$1,784.73\n\n$0.00299686\n\n$0.060622\n\n$0.920661\n\n$0.03224523\n\n$0.648908\n\n$0.0109632\n\n$0.512503\n\n$0.995598\n\n$0.47156\n\n$0.999635\n\n$0.00206433\n\n$81,778.00\n\n$0.99937\n\n$0.00440973\n\n$0.260066\n\n$18.08\n\n$0.999944\n\n$0.02609389\n\nNintendo shared its launch plans for the Switch 2 console in a long-awaited livestream Wednesday, announcing that the successor to the massively popular convertible game device will release in June.\nThe Switch 2 will hit North American retailers on June 5 and sell for $450 on its own, or $500 with a download code for Mario Kart World included.

The system runs a custom Nvidia processor, and while it's definitely more powerful than the original Switch—given not only the 1080p/120fps and 4K TV compatibility, but also the visually upgraded versions of hit Switch games—we don't yet have numbers to point to.\n\nThe Switch 2 will have 256GB of built-in, high-speed storage—that's eight times the local storage from the Switch. And the new console will support microSD Express cards for expandable storage, but not standard microSD cards. Switch 2 buyers will be able to use a transfer feature to move data from an older console.\n\nBattery life for the Switch 2 is estimated between 2-6.5 hours, depending on how you're using the console. On the low end, that's a step down from the standard Switch, but it's in the same ballpark as the Steam Deck.\n\nThe Switch 2 launch will be led by Mario Kart World, which was teased in the original Switch 2 trailer in January. The new Mario Kart looks much like what we've come to expect from the series, but with some ambitious new features.\n\nDrive virtually everywhere in Mario Kart World, a brand-new Mario Kart game releasing exclusively on #NintendoSwitch2 as a launch title! #NintendoDirect pic.twitter.com/zvN4C6l3ft\n\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) April 2, 2025\n\nFor example, all of the tracks are part of an interconnected world, and you'll even drive between the track locations between races. This also opens the door to a free-roam mode that lets you cruise the terrain, either solo or with pals, plus the tracks themselves look larger in scale and support up to 24 simultaneous racers.\n\nAnother major game, Donkey Kong Bananza, is a 3D platform-action game that looks very similar in vibe to the critically acclaimed Super Mario Odyssey from Switch. That one's due out on July 17. Nintendo teased future Switch 2 games like the Zelda action spinoff Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment and racing game Kirby's Air Riders.\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza, a brand-new 3D platforming action adventure is coming exclusively to #NintendoSwitch2 on July 17! #NintendoDirect pic.twitter.com/79mWd3gDja\n\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) April 2, 2025\n\nA pair of games that were previously announced for the original Switch—Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokémon Legends: Z-A—will indeed launch across both systems, each packing an array of visual enhancements on the Switch 2.\n\nNumerous third-party games have also been announced for the Switch 2, including Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades 2, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Street Fighter 6, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, Hitman: World of Assassination, Borderlands 4, and upgraded versions of Sid Meier's Civilization 7 and Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nFrom Software is also bringing an exclusive multiplayer game called The Duskbloods to Switch 2, and fans of the Dark Souls studio have said it gives a similar vibe as From's PS4 favorite Bloodborne.\n\nAnd along with some of the retro games already playable on Switch for Switch Online subscribers, the Switch 2 will add games from the Nintendo GameCube console. Initial games include The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2, and F-Zero GX, with multiplayer games playable online. Nintendo will also sell a Switch 2-compatible wireless GameCube controller.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, most original Switch games will be playable, though there are exceptions. On top of that, Nintendo will also offer upgraded versions of major Switch titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and sequel Tears of the Kingdom, both of which will pack visual enhancements such as crisper graphics and a smoother frame rate.\n\nNintendo will sell these enhanced versions as standalone games, but also offer paid upgrades for players who own the Switch originals. Other Switch games that are set to get enhancements include Super Mario Party: Jamboree and Kirby and the Forgotten Land.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on September 19, 2023 and last updated on April 3, 2025.\n\nIt’s been over four years since the release of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, a pair of game consoles that offer different performance and price options for players.

    "full_content": "# Alleged Tech Spy Says He Was Paid in Ethereum to Snoop for Rival Firm\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 4, 2025\n\nAn Irish man has admitted to accepting $5000 per month in cryptocurrency to spy on payroll management company Rippling on behalf of its competitor, Deel, in a Hollywood-esque corporate espionage scheme that captured global media attention and nearly led him to flee to Dubai.\n\nIn an affidavit, signed on April 1 and filed in Dublin court, Keith O’Brien alleged he became a corporate spy for Deel last September, while he was still an employee of Rippling.\n\nBetween September 2024 and March 2025, O’Brien allegedly used Telegram to feed Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz information about his employer’s corporate strategy and customer insights “multiple times a day every workday” and sometimes on the weekends, according to the sworn statement.\n\n“[Deel’s CEO] suggested that I remain at Rippling and become a ‘spy’ for Deel, and I recall him specifically mentioning James Bond,” O’Brien said in the statement.\n\nDeel executives paid O’Brien $5,000 in Ethereum per month for the espionage, telling their mole the payment method “would leave no trace,” according to O’Brien. The self-confessed spy said he reluctantly received the tokens in his Blockchain.com wallet, where he would liquify the funds and transfer them to his bank account because he was “concerned about cryptocurrency fluctuation.”\n\nThe admission comes a few weeks after Rippling sued Deel in a federal court in San Francisco for allegedly orchestrating “a calculated and unlawful corporate espionage scheme.” The legal drama marks the latest face-off between the HR software companies, which each notched valuations north of $10 billion a few years ago by specializing in solutions for managing remote work forces that have become less common in the post-pandemic era.\n\nThe lawsuit also comes as the crypto industry is trying to rehabilitate its image, pushing back against popular narratives that assert digital assets are favored by bad actors seeking to conceal their crimes.\n\nDisclosure: DASTAN, Decrypt's parent company, was a client of Deel, and now holds a contract with Rippling.\n\nO’Brien said in his statement that Bouaziz at times asked him to search for specific information pertaining to Rippling’s business through the firm’s Slack, Salesforce and Google Drive. The executive ordered O’Brien to plug search terms such as “Tom brady” “iran” “tinybird” and “sanctioned countries” into Rippling’s internal systems, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin slipped below $82,000 on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive new tariffs shook Wall Street and also sent altcoins diving.\nThe leading cryptocurrency dropped 5.8% to $81,732, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Solana, the sixth-largest digital asset by market value, fell 12% to a 13-month low under $113.\nDogecoin, the original and still most valuable meme coin by market cap, fell 10% to about $0.157. And the Ripple-linked XRP has fallen by 7.4% to $1.9...\n\nThe former spy also alleged that Bouaziz seemed particularly interested in information about Deel customers who had signed up for product demonstrations from Rippling.\n\nThe alleged scheme ended in mid-March, when an independent solicitor served O’Brien a court order at Rippling’s Dublin office requiring inspection of the employee’s devices. That night, Deel’s lawyers spoke with O’Brien to explore the possibility of him fleeing with his family to Dubai.\n\nA few days after being served, O’Brien also performed a factory reset on his phone, cut it up with an axe and threw it down a drain at his mother’s house at the direction of Deel’s lawyers.\n\nHowever, he decided to confess to his alleged crimes nearly two weeks later.\n\n“I realized that I was harming myself and my family to protect Deel,” he said in the statement. “I was concerned, and I am still concerned about how wealthy and powerful [Deel’s executives] are, but…I want to do what I can to start making amends and righting these wrongs.”\n\nEdited by James Rubin\n\n$81,937.00\n\n$1,785.29\n\n$2.05\n\n$587.69\n\n$0.999884\n\n$115.19\n\n$0.158798\n\n$0.638905\n\n$0.235905\n\n$1,784.94\n\n$81,937.00\n\n$3.58\n\n$9.38\n\n$12.64\n\n$0.999961\n\n$0.25766\n\n$2,138.48\n\n$18.07\n\n$2.23\n\n$0.00001219\n\n$0.160526\n\n$82.21\n\n$6.40\n\n$4.03\n\n$294.95\n\n$4.46\n\n$0.999454\n\n$1.002\n\n$1,784.86\n\n$1,898.48\n\n$27.55\n\n$0.580355\n\n$209.63\n\n$11.30\n\n$5.74\n\n$5.01\n\n$1.046\n\n$2.46\n\n$0.00000658\n\n$45.95\n\n$81,902.00\n\n$33.32\n\n$21.53\n\n$0.094647\n\n$0.79344\n\n$0.741957\n\n$5.09\n\n$15.97\n\n$0.993736\n\n$1.16\n\n$150.30\n\n$4.52\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.02157484\n\n$9.06\n\n$208.20\n\n$2.69\n\n$81,734.00\n\n$4.04\n\n$3.25\n\n$0.063663\n\n$0.307668\n\n$0.18713\n\n$2.72\n\n$0.175487\n\n$0.465348\n\n$0.303991\n\n$10.36\n\n$81,670.00\n\n$0.822144\n\n$0.428664\n\n$0.683501\n\n$4.23\n\n$1,789.79\n\n$0.380755\n\n$1,248.09\n\n$1,858.03\n\n$1.046\n\n$0.065029\n\n$68.15\n\n$1.001\n\n$120.04\n\n$0.379052\n\n$0.748372\n\n$2,020.11\n\n$0.57582\n\n$15.24\n\n$0.997692\n\n$1.003\n\n$0.00001092\n\n$0.465496\n\n$0.999098\n\n$8.33\n\n$0.01299492\n\n$0.162258\n\n$0.081957\n\n$0.780478\n\n$3,123.42\n\n$0.999511\n\n$81,784.00\n\n$0.809753\n\n$589.51\n\n$1,896.08\n\n$3,126.82\n\n$0.522903\n\n$0.535232\n\n$0.643191\n\n$81,945.00\n\n$0.01470706\n\n$5.94\n\n$0.259442\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.00000063\n\n$38.24\n\n$1.96\n\n$0.103711\n\n$30.10\n\n$0.16089\n\n$0.363751\n\n$147.47\n\n$0.997975\n\n$1,860.24\n\n$1.81\n\n$0.999255\n\n$1.81\n\n$0.00005431\n\n$2.78\n\n$0.996899\n\n$14.85\n\n$126.97\n\n$0.00996623\n\n$0.068835\n\n$0.130982\n\n$0.609815\n\n$0.999748\n\n$0.999676\n\n$2.88\n\n$80,308.00\n\n$6.00\n\n$1.65\n\n$1.00\n\n$27.32\n\n$0.23829\n\n$0.440659\n\n$0.407018\n\n$2.69\n\n$0.00464786\n\n$1,895.46\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$15.02\n\n$46.89\n\n$81,977.00\n\n$83,010.00\n\n$0.664727\n\n$0.159152\n\n$0.997917\n\n$110.54\n\n$1,784.05\n\n$0.429831\n\n$1,786.63\n\n$0.078248\n\n$1.047\n\n$0.086869\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.133203\n\n$1,785.12\n\n$0.04050249\n\n$0.38414\n\n$0.0000194\n\n$1.089\n\n$5.72\n\n$0.374861\n\n$81,756.00\n\n$1,863.37\n\n$0.00635799\n\n$0.178085\n\n$0.546306\n\n$0.43744\n\n$0.998855\n\n$0.131485\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.816016\n\n$0.00644345\n\n$0.187994\n\n$4.65\n\n$1,784.95\n\n$1.003\n\n$0.339411\n\n$1,785.19\n\n$0.00000155\n\n$0.00005788\n\n$0.390015\n\n$0.03114433\n\n$1.43\n\n$115.73\n\n$0.00476545\n\n$2.68\n\n$0.999242\n\n$0.518295\n\n$0.02964793\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.00883042\n\n$0.00346828\n\n$1,760.21\n\n$81,629.00\n\n$1.13\n\n$0.225057\n\n$1,785.18\n\n$2.83\n\n$81,784.00\n\n$1.11\n\n$0.524089\n\n$3,108.36\n\n$0.592012\n\n$0.222661\n\n$21.23\n\n$1,883.68\n\n$0.183035\n\n$1,954.57\n\n$0.00273893\n\n$14.93\n\n$3.10\n\n$0.116556\n\n$1,943.03\n\n$0.0296072\n\n$21.10\n\n$0.231248\n\n$1,644.08\n\n$0.099695\n\n$1,784.73\n\n$0.00299686\n\n$0.060622\n\n$0.920661\n\n$0.03224523\n\n$0.648908\n\n$0.0109632\n\n$0.512503\n\n$0.995598\n\n$0.47156\n\n$0.999635\n\n$0.00206433\n\n$81,778.00\n\n$0.99937\n\n$0.00440973\n\n$0.260066\n\n$18.08\n\n$0.999944\n\n$0.02609389\n\nThe price of Bitcoin slipped below $82,000 on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive new tariffs shook Wall Street and also sent altcoins diving.\nThe leading cryptocurrency dropped 5.8% to $81,732, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

    "full_content": "# Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade Set for May Following Technical Hurdles\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 4, 2025\n\nPectra, one of Ethereum’s largest upgrades since transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in 2022, is now set to hit the Ethereum mainnet on May 7.\n\nOriginally scheduled for a March 2025 release, Pectra was delayed due to finality issues on the Holesky testnet, but has been running without major incident on the Hoodi testnet that was spun up in response to the testnet issues. The upgrade also experienced a minor issue on the Sepolia testnet in early March, but it was later identified and fixed.\n\nEthereum developers utilize testnets to trial upgrades before implementing them on the mainnet. Despite initial issues, Ethereum’s Holesky testnet did eventually reach finality on March 10.\n\nEthereum testnet Holesky has achieved finality, an important step amid delays and numerous technical issues ahead of the Pectra upgrade.

    "full_content": "# Pedophile Platform That Accepted Crypto Taken Down in Global Operation\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 3, 2025\n\nOne of the largest pedophile platforms in the world has been shut down after an international investigation, with crypto widely used as a payment method for images of child sexual abuse.\n\n\"Kidflix\" resembled a streaming service—and according to Europol, 1.8 million users worldwide had logged on to the site between April 2022 and March of this year.\n\nDetectives have identified 1,275 people who either purchased child sexual assault material using digital assets, or earned credits by uploading their own material.\n\nSo far, 79 suspects have been arrested and more than 3,000 electronic devices have been seized, with 39 children protected from further abuse.\n\nEuropol has warned that blockchain and AI will “accelerate serious and organised crime” in the coming years, with a new report from the EU law enforcement agency even predicting that fully autonomous AI “could pave the way for entirely AI-controlled criminal networks.”\nIn its 2025 Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment, Europol suggested that the combination of AI and crypto will serve to expand online fraud schemes, which already represent “the most rapidly expanding sector” in organised...\n\nEuropol says this was the largest child sexual exploitation operation in its history—and Kidflix was more sophisticated than other pedophile platforms taken down in the past.\n\nMore than 91,000 unique videos with a total running time of 6,288 hours had been uploaded to the site, with an average of 3.5 new clips uploaded every hour. Law enforcement had been previously unaware about most of this footage.\n\nEach video was also available in low, medium or high quality, with pedophiles paying a premium for larger files.\n\nMore than 35 countries from around the world were involved in the operation to shut the dark web site, led by investigators from the German state of Bavaria.\n\nEuropol collaborated with law enforcement authorities from six countries to bring down an international drug trafficking ring employing crypto for its financial needs.\nEuropol said it has taken down “underground bankers who were moving and laundering the proceeds of large-scale drug trafficking and other serious crimes” in a recent announcement.\nWhen contacted by Decrypt, Europol explained that it is “not authorised to disclose any more details.”\nBitcoin Still 'Most Abused' Crypto Asset Among Cr...\n\nEuropol executive director Catherine De Bolle warned there are \"real victims\" behind these crimes, adding: \"The digital dimension has driven a rapid evolution in online child sexual exploitation, offering offenders a borderless platform to contact and groom victims, as well as to create, store, and exchange child sexual abuse material. Some attempt to frame this as merely a technical or cyber issue—but it is not.\"\n\nIn a statement, the U.K. National Crime Agency confirmed that 63 British users of Kidflix had been identified so far—and of those, 30 have been arrested.\n\nBitcoin is still the cryptocurrency that is ‘most abused’ by criminals, despite the introduction of privacy coins such as Monero, according to a new report from the Europol Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment.\nThe report found that Bitcoin (BTC) is the asset most demanded by ransomware groups for their payment—presumably due to the ease with which non-savvy users can procure Bitcoin over assets like Monero (XMR).\nStill, criminals tend to convert Bitcoin to stablecoins to avoid market vola...\n\n\"Providing this global to local response

Law enforcement had been previously unaware about most of this footage.\n\nEach video was also available in low, medium or high quality, with pedophiles paying a premium for larger files.\n\nMore than 35 countries from around the world were involved in the operation to shut the dark web site, led by investigators from the German state of Bavaria.\n\nEuropol collaborated with law enforcement authorities from six countries to bring down an international drug trafficking ring employing crypto for its financial needs.\nEuropol said it has taken down “underground bankers who were moving and laundering the proceeds of large-scale drug trafficking and other serious crimes” in a recent announcement.\nWhen contacted by Decrypt, Europol explained that it is “not authorised to disclose any more details.”\nBitcoin Still 'Most Abused' Crypto Asset Among Cr...\n\nEuropol executive director Catherine De Bolle warned there are \"real victims\" behind these crimes, adding: \"The digital dimension has driven a rapid evolution in online child sexual exploitation, offering offenders a borderless platform to contact and groom victims, as well as to create, store, and exchange child sexual abuse material. Some attempt to frame this as merely a technical or cyber issue—but it is not.\"\n\nIn a statement, the U.K. National Crime Agency confirmed that 63 British users of Kidflix had been identified so far—and of those, 30 have been arrested.\n\nBitcoin is still the cryptocurrency that is ‘most abused’ by criminals, despite the introduction of privacy coins such as Monero, according to a new report from the Europol Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment.\nThe report found that Bitcoin (BTC) is the asset most demanded by ransomware groups for their payment—presumably due to the ease with which non-savvy users can procure Bitcoin over assets like Monero (XMR).\nStill, criminals tend to convert Bitcoin to stablecoins to avoid market vola...\n\n\"Providing this global to local response is paramount in our role to protect children from child sexual abuse and criminals who seek out this content,\" NCA senior manager Neil Keeping said.\n\nThe traceability of digital assets helps detectives bring criminals to justice, as crypto transfers can be monitored through blockchain analytics.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott.\n\nAn Irish man has admitted to accepting $5000 per month in cryptocurrency to spy on payroll management company Rippling on behalf of its competitor, Deel, in a Hollywood-esque corporate espionage scheme that captured global media attention and nearly led him to flee to Dubai. \nIn an affidavit, signed on April 1 and filed in Dublin court, Keith O’Brien alleged he became a corporate spy for Deel last September, while he was still an employee of Rippling. \nBetween September 2024 and March 2025, O’Br...\n\nA financial services firm has been fined over $400,000 after pleading guilty to wash trading in a Boston court.\nCLS Global, a firm that specializes in market making, was ordered to pay a total of $428,059 to the government, in the form of seized cryptocurrency and fines.\nThe company was also sentenced to three years’ probation, during which time it will not be able to participate in U.S. cryptocurrency markets.\nThese charges followed an undercover law enforcement operation which specifically tar...\n\nA $400 million crypto payday tied to the Trump family is now the focus of an escalating political firestorm, one that lawmakers say could compromise the integrity of U.S. financial regulation.\nOn April 2, Sen.

    "full_content": "# Bitcoin and Dogecoin Dive, Solana Hits 13-Month Low as Trump Tariffs Shake Markets\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 3, 2025\n\nThe price of Bitcoin slipped below $82,000 on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive new tariffs shook Wall Street and also sent altcoins diving.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency dropped 5.8% to $81,732, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Solana, the sixth-largest digital asset by market value, fell 12% to a 13-month low under $113.\n\nDogecoin, the original and still most valuable meme coin by market cap, fell 10% to about $0.157. And the Ripple-linked XRP has fallen by 7.4% to $1.99.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. equity futures and major cryptos fell sharply after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on 185 countries, rattling global markets and triggering a broad risk-off move.\nThe Kobeissi Letter described the scene as “truly insane to watch,” noting that markets reversed violently as Trump unveiled tariff rates nation by nation during his \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event.\nThe S&P 500 lost more than $2 trillion in market capitalization within 15 minutes. Nasdaq 100...\n\nInvestors were reeling as Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on 185 countries prompted questions of retaliatory measures from America’s adversaries and allies, while also weighing on economic growth forecasts worldwide and bolstering inflation concerns.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 4%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 5.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered close to correction territory—or 10% off its December high.\n\nTrump unveiled a 10% baseline tariff on all goods imported to the U.S. on Wednesday, but countries including China and the European Union were hit with outsized levies, totaling 34% and 20%, respectively.

It was seen as a major sign that the incoming administration would act more favorably towards the crypto industry.\n\nAs such, it soared to a $15.18 billion market cap within its first day. But it soon tumbled by over 64% to $5.42 billion, after the First Lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin—which was later linked to the issuers of the controversial LIBRA token.\n\nFollowing Liberation Day, TRUMP has tanked 15.4% to a market cap of $1.78 billion, according to CoinGecko, lows only seen within three hours of the token’s launch. Its slide outpaced that of other leading cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping 5.2% on the day, Ethereum (ETH) sliding 6.5%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) 9.8%.\n\nSince regaining power, President Trump has launched a trade war, promising to implement tariffs across the globe.\n\n\"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" Trump said at the Liberation Day event. “Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years.

It was seen as a major sign that the incoming administration would act more favorably towards the crypto industry.\n\nAs such, it soared to a $15.18 billion market cap within its first day. But it soon tumbled by over 64% to $5.42 billion, after the First Lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin—which was later linked to the issuers of the controversial LIBRA token.\n\nFollowing Liberation Day, TRUMP has tanked 15.4% to a market cap of $1.78 billion, according to CoinGecko, lows only seen within three hours of the token’s launch. Its slide outpaced that of other leading cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping 5.2% on the day, Ethereum (ETH) sliding 6.5%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) 9.8%.\n\nSince regaining power, President Trump has launched a trade war, promising to implement tariffs across the globe.\n\n\"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" Trump said at the Liberation Day event. “Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years.

    "full_content": "# Senate Banking Committee Advances Trump's SEC Chair Pick Paul Atkins\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 3, 2025\n\nPaul Atkins, President Trump’s nominee to become the next Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, passed a key vote from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.\n\nFollowing the 13-11 vote, in which all Democrats on the Committee opposed Trump’s pick, Atkins’ nomination will now proceed to the Senate floor for a full vote.\n\nAtkins is an SEC veteran who previously served as an agency commissioner under President George W. Bush. He is widely expected to institute favorable policies for the crypto industry.\n\nPaul Atkins, the Trump administration’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, said regulation of crypto will be a top priority if confirmed as chairman.\nIn prepared remarks ahead of a confirmation hearing Thursday morning before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Atkins took aim at “ambiguous and non-existent” digital asset regulation that has hindered market growth.\n“Since 2017, as I have led industry efforts to develop best practices for the digital ass...\n\nLast week, during a confirmation hearing before the Senate, Atkins declared that creating a “regulatory foundation for digital assets” will be a top priority of his chairmanship.\n\nNotably, several Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee who previously embraced crypto legislation opposed Atkins’ nomination on Thursday. Just last month, five of those Democrats voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill that would create a regulatory framework for issuing stablecoins in the United States.\n\nSen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), a co-sponsor of that legislation, opposed Atkins’ nomination today. So did Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), the top Democrat on the Senate’s new Digital Assets Subcommittee.\n\nThe vote may have come down to more than crypto. In recent weeks, Democratic lawmakers have come under fire from hometown constituencies who feel they have not done enough to block the quickly accelerating moves of the second Trump administration.

    "full_content": "# Ronin Games 'Forgotten Runiverse' and 'Pixels' Team Up for PIXEL Collab\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 3, 2025\n\nPixels and Forgotten Runiverse, a pair of crypto games on the gaming-focused Ethereum scaling network Ronin, are teaming up to bring Pixels’ PIXEL token to the Runiverse—the massively-multiplayer online role-playing game or MMORPG that just opened to the public in early access.\n\nForgotten Runiverse, developed by Biosonic, is based on the lore of the Ethereum NFT collection Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult. The game opted to move from layer-2 Arbitrum to Ronin in July 2024 and will eventually have its own native token, XP, which will act as the ecosystem token for Forgotten Runes.\n\nSocial farming game Pixels also made its own move to Ronin in late 2023, driving substantial renewed attention to the Ethereum network ahead of last year’s launch of the PIXEL token. Amid a recent push to open up Ronin to all builders, the two teams are now collaborating.\n\nRole-playing game Forgotten Runiverse has launched in early access on the Ronin Network, allowing users to master spells and earn rewards as they explore the open fantasy world based on the Ethereum NFT collection, Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult. \nThe launch is the culmination of three years of development work and more than 1 million hours of gameplay testing, according to a post by Ronin Network, the game’s new home after it opted to migrate from Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum last year. \n“W...\n\n“We’ve always seen a lot of potential synergy between our teams, as we both are focused on creating interoperable, sustainable Web3 economies, and we’re constantly thinking about how we can work together to push that vision forward,” Pixels founder Luke Barwikowski told Decrypt.\n\n“Honestly, if there’s one thing the industry needs right now, it’s more collaboration,” he added. “Ultimately, this is a win-win for all of us.”\n\nThanks to the collaboration, Runiverse players will be able to claim PIXEL rewards with Quanta—the in-game currency of the Forgotten Runiverse. PIXEL will also be used for purchasing mana, boosts, and exclusive items within the game.\n\n“By integrating PIXEL into the Runiverse, we’re offering players the chance to engage with a proven token economy inside a new game,” Biosonic COO Shane Bierwith told Decrypt. “This not only adds immediate utility for PIXEL, but also strengthens our own ecosystem as we prepare to launch our native token, XP.”\n\nThe teams expect that the integration will not only enhance token utility for PIXEL, but also “offer valuable data to optimize player engagement and play-to-earn strategies.”\n\n“Success, for us, comes down to the data,” said Barwikowski. “We’re all about using big data, AI, and predictive analytics to refine our play-to-earn models and boost reward efficiency.”\n\nThe team behind popular Ethereum farming game Pixels announced Monday that it will publish a new spinoff game called Pixel Dungeons, which serves up dungeon-based combat and lets players earn the same familiar PIXEL token.\nThe new game, developed in partnership with Crack and Stack, introduces a fast-paced competitive setting where players navigate dangerous dungeons, collect crypto rewards, and battle opponents. Players have two minutes to mine PIXEL tokens, use TNT to defeat goblins, and avoid...\n\n“Partnering with Forgotten Runiverse allows us to dive deep into player behavior, optimize our P2E systems, and ultimately improve retention and engagement,” he continued. “By building more insights through this partnership, we aim to develop strategies and data points that we can take to additional teams in the future.”\n\nBierwith too will be analyzing the data, telling Decrypt that Biosonic will measure “how effectively PIXEL drives repeat engagement, retention, and meaningful in-game spend,” including how many users swap Quanta into PIXEL and how it’s used in the game’s gacha-style rewards system called the Font of Memory.\n\nTo commemorate the collaboration, Runiverse-themed quests will launch in Pixels, plus a special Runiverse avatar will be available prior to the official launch of PIXEL in the fantasy MMORPG. That token integration is expected to take place sometime this quarter.\n\nThe makers of seminal play-to-earn game Axie Infinity just announced the franchise’s new massively multiplayer online—or MMO—game, Axie Infinity: Atia’s Legacy.

The game opted to move from layer-2 Arbitrum to Ronin in July 2024 and will eventually have its own native token, XP, which will act as the ecosystem token for Forgotten Runes.\n\nSocial farming game Pixels also made its own move to Ronin in late 2023, driving substantial renewed attention to the Ethereum network ahead of last year’s launch of the PIXEL token. Amid a recent push to open up Ronin to all builders, the two teams are now collaborating.\n\nRole-playing game Forgotten Runiverse has launched in early access on the Ronin Network, allowing users to master spells and earn rewards as they explore the open fantasy world based on the Ethereum NFT collection, Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult. \nThe launch is the culmination of three years of development work and more than 1 million hours of gameplay testing, according to a post by Ronin Network, the game’s new home after it opted to migrate from Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum last year. \n“W...\n\n“We’ve always seen a lot of potential synergy between our teams, as we both are focused on creating interoperable, sustainable Web3 economies, and we’re constantly thinking about how we can work together to push that vision forward,” Pixels founder Luke Barwikowski told Decrypt.\n\n“Honestly, if there’s one thing the industry needs right now, it’s more collaboration,” he added. “Ultimately, this is a win-win for all of us.”\n\nThanks to the collaboration, Runiverse players will be able to claim PIXEL rewards with Quanta—the in-game currency of the Forgotten Runiverse. PIXEL will also be used for purchasing mana, boosts, and exclusive items within the game.\n\n“By integrating PIXEL into the Runiverse, we’re offering players the chance to engage with a proven token economy inside a new game,” Biosonic COO Shane Bierwith told Decrypt. “This not only adds immediate utility for PIXEL, but also strengthens our own ecosystem as we prepare to launch our native token, XP.”\n\nThe teams expect that the integration will not only enhance token utility for PIXEL, but also “offer valuable data to optimize player engagement and play-to-earn strategies.”\n\n“Success, for us, comes down to the data,” said Barwikowski. “We’re all about using big data, AI, and predictive analytics to refine our play-to-earn models and boost reward efficiency.”\n\nThe team behind popular Ethereum farming game Pixels announced Monday that it will publish a new spinoff game called Pixel Dungeons, which serves up dungeon-based combat and lets players earn the same familiar PIXEL token.\nThe new game, developed in partnership with Crack and Stack, introduces a fast-paced competitive setting where players navigate dangerous dungeons, collect crypto rewards, and battle opponents. Players have two minutes to mine PIXEL tokens, use TNT to defeat goblins, and avoid...\n\n“Partnering with Forgotten Runiverse allows us to dive deep into player behavior, optimize our P2E systems, and ultimately improve retention and engagement,” he continued. “By building more insights through this partnership, we aim to develop strategies and data points that we can take to additional teams in the future.”\n\nBierwith too will be analyzing the data, telling Decrypt that Biosonic will measure “how effectively PIXEL drives repeat engagement, retention, and meaningful in-game spend,” including how many users swap Quanta into PIXEL and how it’s used in the game’s gacha-style rewards system called the Font of Memory.\n\nTo commemorate the collaboration, Runiverse-themed quests will launch in Pixels, plus a special Runiverse avatar will be available prior to the official launch of PIXEL in the fantasy MMORPG. That token integration is expected to take place sometime this quarter.\n\nThe makers of seminal play-to-earn game Axie Infinity just announced the franchise’s new massively multiplayer online—or MMO—game, Axie Infinity: Atia’s Legacy.
