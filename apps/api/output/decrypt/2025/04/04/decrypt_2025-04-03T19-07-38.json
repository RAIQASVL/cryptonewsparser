    "full_content": "# Alleged Tech Spy Says He Was Paid in Ethereum to Snoop for Rival Firm\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 4, 2025\n\nAn Irish man has admitted to accepting $5000 per month in cryptocurrency to spy on payroll management company Rippling on behalf of its competitor, Deel, in a Hollywood-esque corporate espionage scheme that captured global media attention and nearly led him to flee to Dubai.\n\nIn an affidavit, signed on April 1 and filed in Dublin court, Keith O’Brien alleged he became a corporate spy for Deel last September, while he was still an employee of Rippling.\n\nBetween September 2024 and March 2025, O’Brien allegedly used Telegram to feed Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz information about his employer’s corporate strategy and customer insights “multiple times a day every workday” and sometimes on the weekends, according to the sworn statement.\n\n“[Deel’s CEO] suggested that I remain at Rippling and become a ‘spy’ for Deel, and I recall him specifically mentioning James Bond,” O’Brien said in the statement.\n\nDeel executives paid O’Brien $5,000 in Ethereum per month for the espionage, telling their mole the payment method “would leave no trace,” according to O’Brien. The self-confessed spy said he reluctantly received the tokens in his Blockchain.com wallet, where he would liquify the funds and transfer them to his bank account because he was “concerned about cryptocurrency fluctuation.”\n\nThe admission comes a few weeks after Rippling sued Deel in a federal court in San Francisco for allegedly orchestrating “a calculated and unlawful corporate espionage scheme.” The legal drama marks the latest face-off between the HR software companies, which each notched valuations north of $10 billion a few years ago by specializing in solutions for managing remote work forces that have become less common in the post-pandemic era.\n\nThe lawsuit also comes as the crypto industry is trying to rehabilitate its image, pushing back against popular narratives that assert digital assets are favored by bad actors seeking to conceal their crimes.\n\nDASTAN, Decrypt's parent company, was a client of Deel, and now holds a contract with Rippling.\n\nO’Brien said in his statement that Bouaziz at times asked him to search for specific information pertaining to Rippling’s business through the firm’s Slack, Salesforce and Google Drive. The executive ordered O’Brien to plug search terms such as “Tom brady” “iran” “tinybird” and “sanctioned countries” into Rippling’s internal systems, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin slipped below $82,000 on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive new tariffs shook Wall Street and also sent altcoins diving.\nThe leading cryptocurrency dropped 5.8% to $81,732, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Solana, the sixth-largest digital asset by market value, fell 12% to a 13-month low under $113.\nDogecoin, the original and still most valuable meme coin by market cap, fell 10% to about $0.157. And the Ripple-linked XRP has fallen by 7.4% to $1.9...\n\nThe former spy also alleged that Bouaziz seemed particularly interested in information about Deel customers who had signed up for product demonstrations from Rippling.\n\nThe alleged scheme ended in mid-March, when an independent solicitor served O’Brien a court order at Rippling’s Dublin office requiring inspection of the employee’s devices. That night, Deel’s lawyers spoke with O’Brien to explore the possibility of him fleeing with his family to Dubai.\n\nA few days after being served, O’Brien also performed a factory reset on his phone, cut it up with an axe and threw it down a drain at his mother’s house at the direction of Deel’s lawyers.\n\nHowever, he decided to confess to his alleged crimes nearly two weeks later.\n\n“I realized that I was harming myself and my family to protect Deel,” he said in the statement. “I was concerned, and I am still concerned about how wealthy and powerful [Deel’s executives] are, but…I want to do what I can to start making amends and righting these wrongs.”\n\nEdited by James Rubin\n\n$82,112.00\n\n$1,789.12\n\n$2.05\n\n$588.95\n\n$0.999889\n\n$115.28\n\n$0.159076\n\n$0.638981\n\n$0.235826\n\n$1,786.92\n\n$81,991.00\n\n$3.59\n\n$9.40\n\n$12.65\n\n$0.999913\n\n$0.257398\n\n$2,141.18\n\n$18.14\n\n$2.24\n\n$0.00001222\n\n$0.161088\n\n$82.19\n\n$6.40\n\n$4.03\n\n$295.06\n\n$4.47\n\n$0.999087\n\n$0.999023\n\n$1,789.46\n\n$1,902.73\n\n$27.56\n\n$0.577905\n\n$210.43\n\n$11.51\n\n$5.75\n\n$5.03\n\n$1.046\n\n$2.46\n\n$0.00000659\n\n$46.02\n\n$82,109.00\n\n$33.40\n\n$21.60\n\n$0.094939\n\n$0.795067\n\n$0.742915\n\n$5.08\n\n$15.96\n\n$0.994841\n\n$1.17\n\n$150.45\n\n$4.52\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.02152941\n\n$9.09\n\n$208.29\n\n$82,134.00\n\n$2.69\n\n$4.04\n\n$3.26\n\n$0.063727\n\n$0.310852\n\n$0.187351\n\n$2.73\n\n$0.174883\n\n$0.465085\n\n$0.304329\n\n$10.32\n\n$81,650.00\n\n$0.819859\n\n$0.428244\n\n$0.682652\n\n$4.24\n\n$1,787.71\n\n$0.378968\n\n$1,252.14\n\n$1,859.89\n\n$1.043\n\n$0.065168\n\n$68.14\n\n$1.001\n\n$120.17\n\n$0.380018\n\n$0.746251\n\n$2,023.19\n\n$0.578011\n\n$15.26\n\n$0.997531\n\n$0.999374\n\n$0.0000109\n\n$0.46675\n\n$0.999839\n\n$8.32\n\n$0.01315542\n\n$0.16209\n\n$0.082123\n\n$0.777793\n\n$3,122.03\n\n$0.999025\n\n$81,655.00\n\n$0.810555\n\n$588.14\n\n$1,898.47\n\n$3,123.52\n\n$0.537563\n\n$0.512906\n\n$0.643496\n\n$82,139.00\n\n$5.99\n\n$0.01470664\n\n$0.259787\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.00000063\n\n$1.97\n\n$0.103701\n\n$37.90\n\n$30.10\n\n$0.160724\n\n$0.364034\n\n$147.30\n\n$1.00\n\n$1,863.73\n\n$1.81\n\n$0.999128\n\n$0.00005436\n\n$1.80\n\n$2.77\n\n$0.99727\n\n$14.88\n\n$126.98\n\n$0.0688\n\n$0.131007\n\n$0.00981856\n\n$0.6107\n\n$0.999762\n\n$1.00\n\n$80,364.00\n\n$2.88\n\n$6.04\n\n$1.00\n\n$1.65\n\n$27.33\n\n$0.238013\n\n$0.442145\n\n$0.407694\n\n$1,899.84\n\n$2.67\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$0.00463174\n\n$15.02\n\n$47.06\n\n$82,055.00\n\n$83,052.00\n\n$0.664087\n\n$0.158826\n\n$0.999209\n\n$110.54\n\n$1,790.54\n\n$0.430225\n\n$0.087455\n\n$1,789.64\n\n$0.078406\n\n$1.047\n\n$0.387373\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.133164\n\n$0.00001944\n\n$1,787.61\n\n$0.04048694\n\n$1.088\n\n$5.74\n\n$0.374518\n\n$81,943.00\n\n$1,867.10\n\n$0.178152\n\n$0.548366\n\n$0.00634851\n\n$0.436026\n\n$0.998783\n\n$0.130653\n\n$0.998076\n\n$0.817167\n\n$0.0064796\n\n$0.187623\n\n$4.66\n\n$1,787.35\n\n$0.998688\n\n$0.340943\n\n$1,786.80\n\n$0.00000156\n\n$0.390838\n\n$0.00005798\n\n$0.031183\n\n$1.47\n\n$116.01\n\n$2.69\n\n$0.00474743\n\n$0.52154\n\n$1.003\n\n$0.999157\n\n$0.00887269\n\n$0.02958044\n\n$0.00346393\n\n$3.70\n\n$82,850.00\n\n$1,762.97\n\n$1.13\n\n$0.225642\n\n$1,787.68\n\n$2.83\n\n$81,889.00\n\n$1.11\n\n$0.525541\n\n$3,107.32\n\n$0.592973\n\n$0.222737\n\n$21.27\n\n$0.183585\n\n$1,888.99\n\n$1,957.26\n\n$0.00274827\n\n$14.95\n\n$0.116682\n\n$1,946.03\n\n$0.02960379\n\n$21.11\n\n$0.231775\n\n$1,646.50\n\n$0.099772\n\n$0.927191\n\n$1,774.40\n\n$0.00299414\n\n$0.060686\n\n$0.03228429\n\n$0.648788\n\n$0.01096908\n\n$0.513235\n\n$0.995352\n\n$0.470324\n\n$0.999481\n\n$0.00205854\n\n$81,900.00\n\n$0.999249\n\n$0.00442088\n\n$0.260501\n\n$18.12\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.02613897\n\nThe price of Bitcoin slipped below $82,000 on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive new tariffs shook Wall Street and also sent altcoins diving.\nThe leading cryptocurrency dropped 5.8% to $81,732, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

    "full_content": "# Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade Set for May Following Technical Hurdles\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 4, 2025\n\nPectra, one of Ethereum’s largest upgrades since transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in 2022, is now set to hit the Ethereum mainnet on May 7.\n\nOriginally scheduled for a March 2025 release, Pectra was delayed due to finality issues on the Holesky testnet, but has been running without major incident on the Hoodi testnet that was spun up in response to the testnet issues. The upgrade also experienced a minor issue on the Sepolia testnet in early March, but it was later identified and fixed.\n\nEthereum developers utilize testnets to trial upgrades before implementing them on the mainnet. Despite initial issues, Ethereum’s Holesky testnet did eventually reach finality on March 10.\n\nEthereum testnet Holesky has achieved finality, an important step amid delays and numerous technical issues ahead of the Pectra upgrade. It’ll be the blockchain’s biggest since 2022’s The Merge.\nThe milestone was achieved at roughly 3 p.m. ET on March 10, according to data from Etherscan.\nThe Ethereum community uses these testnets to trial updates before they go live. It’s all to avoid disrupting the main Ethereum blockchain in the process.

Law enforcement had been previously unaware about most of this footage.\n\nEach video was also available in low, medium or high quality, with pedophiles paying a premium for larger files.\n\nMore than 35 countries from around the world were involved in the operation to shut the dark web site, led by investigators from the German state of Bavaria.\n\nEuropol collaborated with law enforcement authorities from six countries to bring down an international drug trafficking ring employing crypto for its financial needs.\nEuropol said it has taken down “underground bankers who were moving and laundering the proceeds of large-scale drug trafficking and other serious crimes” in a recent announcement.\nWhen contacted by Decrypt, Europol explained that it is “not authorised to disclose any more details.”\nBitcoin Still 'Most Abused' Crypto Asset Among Cr...\n\nEuropol executive director Catherine De Bolle warned there are \"real victims\" behind these crimes, adding: \"The digital dimension has driven a rapid evolution in online child sexual exploitation, offering offenders a borderless platform to contact and groom victims, as well as to create, store, and exchange child sexual abuse material. Some attempt to frame this as merely a technical or cyber issue—but it is not.\"\n\nIn a statement, the U.K. National Crime Agency confirmed that 63 British users of Kidflix had been identified so far—and of those, 30 have been arrested.\n\nBitcoin is still the cryptocurrency that is ‘most abused’ by criminals, despite the introduction of privacy coins such as Monero, according to a new report from the Europol Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment.\nThe report found that Bitcoin (BTC) is the asset most demanded by ransomware groups for their payment—presumably due to the ease with which non-savvy users can procure Bitcoin over assets like Monero (XMR).\nStill, criminals tend to convert Bitcoin to stablecoins to avoid market vola...\n\n\"Providing this global to local response

Law enforcement had been previously unaware about most of this footage.\n\nEach video was also available in low, medium or high quality, with pedophiles paying a premium for larger files.\n\nMore than 35 countries from around the world were involved in the operation to shut the dark web site, led by investigators from the German state of Bavaria.\n\nEuropol collaborated with law enforcement authorities from six countries to bring down an international drug trafficking ring employing crypto for its financial needs.\nEuropol said it has taken down “underground bankers who were moving and laundering the proceeds of large-scale drug trafficking and other serious crimes” in a recent announcement.\nWhen contacted by Decrypt, Europol explained that it is “not authorised to disclose any more details.”\nBitcoin Still 'Most Abused' Crypto Asset Among Cr...\n\nEuropol executive director Catherine De Bolle warned there are \"real victims\" behind these crimes, adding: \"The digital dimension has driven a rapid evolution in online child sexual exploitation, offering offenders a borderless platform to contact and groom victims, as well as to create, store, and exchange child sexual abuse material. Some attempt to frame this as merely a technical or cyber issue—but it is not.\"\n\nIn a statement, the U.K. National Crime Agency confirmed that 63 British users of Kidflix had been identified so far—and of those, 30 have been arrested.\n\nBitcoin is still the cryptocurrency that is ‘most abused’ by criminals, despite the introduction of privacy coins such as Monero, according to a new report from the Europol Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment.\nThe report found that Bitcoin (BTC) is the asset most demanded by ransomware groups for their payment—presumably due to the ease with which non-savvy users can procure Bitcoin over assets like Monero (XMR).\nStill, criminals tend to convert Bitcoin to stablecoins to avoid market vola...\n\n\"Providing this global to local response is paramount in our role to protect children from child sexual abuse and criminals who seek out this content,\" NCA senior manager Neil Keeping said.\n\nThe traceability of digital assets helps detectives bring criminals to justice, as crypto transfers can be monitored through blockchain analytics.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott.\n\nA financial services firm has been fined over $400,000 after pleading guilty to wash trading in a Boston court.\nCLS Global, a firm that specializes in market making, was ordered to pay a total of $428,059 to the government, in the form of seized cryptocurrency and fines.\nThe company was also sentenced to three years’ probation, during which time it will not be able to participate in U.S. cryptocurrency markets.\nThese charges followed an undercover law enforcement operation which specifically tar...\n\nA $400 million crypto payday tied to the Trump family is now the focus of an escalating political firestorm, one that lawmakers say could compromise the integrity of U.S. financial regulation.\nOn April 2, Sen.

    "full_content": "# Bitcoin and Dogecoin Dive, Solana Hits 13-Month Low as Trump Tariffs Shake Markets\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 3, 2025\n\nThe price of Bitcoin slipped below $82,000 on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive new tariffs shook Wall Street and also sent altcoins diving.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency dropped 5.8% to $81,732, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Solana, the sixth-largest digital asset by market value, fell 12% to a 13-month low under $113.\n\nDogecoin, the original and still most valuable meme coin by market cap, fell 10% to about $0.157. And the Ripple-linked XRP has fallen by 7.4% to $1.99.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. equity futures and major cryptos fell sharply after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on 185 countries, rattling global markets and triggering a broad risk-off move.\nThe Kobeissi Letter described the scene as “truly insane to watch,” noting that markets reversed violently as Trump unveiled tariff rates nation by nation during his \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event.\nThe S&P 500 lost more than $2 trillion in market capitalization within 15 minutes. Nasdaq 100...\n\nInvestors were reeling as Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on 185 countries prompted questions of retaliatory measures from America’s adversaries and allies, while also weighing on economic growth forecasts worldwide and bolstering inflation concerns.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 4%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 5.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered close to correction territory—or 10% off its December high.\n\nTrump unveiled a 10% baseline tariff on all goods imported to the U.S. on Wednesday, but countries including China and the European Union were hit with outsized levies, totaling 34% and 20%, respectively.

It was seen as a major sign that the incoming administration would act more favorably towards the crypto industry.\n\nAs such, it soared to a $15.18 billion market cap within its first day. But it soon tumbled by over 64% to $5.42 billion, after the First Lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin—which was later linked to the issuers of the controversial LIBRA token.\n\nFollowing Liberation Day, TRUMP has tanked 15.4% to a market cap of $1.78 billion, according to CoinGecko, lows only seen within three hours of the token’s launch. Its slide outpaced that of other leading cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping 5.2% on the day, Ethereum (ETH) sliding 6.5%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) 9.8%.\n\nSince regaining power, President Trump has launched a trade war, promising to implement tariffs across the globe.\n\n\"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" Trump said at the Liberation Day event. “Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years.

It was seen as a major sign that the incoming administration would act more favorably towards the crypto industry.\n\nAs such, it soared to a $15.18 billion market cap within its first day. But it soon tumbled by over 64% to $5.42 billion, after the First Lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin—which was later linked to the issuers of the controversial LIBRA token.\n\nFollowing Liberation Day, TRUMP has tanked 15.4% to a market cap of $1.78 billion, according to CoinGecko, lows only seen within three hours of the token’s launch. Its slide outpaced that of other leading cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping 5.2% on the day, Ethereum (ETH) sliding 6.5%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) 9.8%.\n\nSince regaining power, President Trump has launched a trade war, promising to implement tariffs across the globe.\n\n\"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" Trump said at the Liberation Day event. “Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years.

    "full_content": "# Senate Banking Committee Advances Trump's SEC Chair Pick Paul Atkins\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 3, 2025\n\nPaul Atkins, President Trump’s nominee to become the next Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, passed a key vote from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.\n\nFollowing the 13-11 vote, in which all Democrats on the Committee opposed Trump’s pick, Atkins’ nomination will now proceed to the Senate floor for a full vote.\n\nAtkins is an SEC veteran who previously served as an agency commissioner under President George W. Bush. He is widely expected to institute favorable policies for the crypto industry.\n\nPaul Atkins, the Trump administration’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, said regulation of crypto will be a top priority if confirmed as chairman.\nIn prepared remarks ahead of a confirmation hearing Thursday morning before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Atkins took aim at “ambiguous and non-existent” digital asset regulation that has hindered market growth.\n“Since 2017, as I have led industry efforts to develop best practices for the digital ass...\n\nLast week, during a confirmation hearing before the Senate, Atkins declared that creating a “regulatory foundation for digital assets” will be a top priority of his chairmanship.\n\nNotably, several Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee who previously embraced crypto legislation opposed Atkins’ nomination on Thursday. Just last month, five of those Democrats voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill that would create a regulatory framework for issuing stablecoins in the United States.\n\nSen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), a co-sponsor of that legislation, opposed Atkins’ nomination today. So did Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), the top Democrat on the Senate’s new Digital Assets Subcommittee.\n\nThe vote may have come down to more than crypto. In recent weeks, Democratic lawmakers have come under fire from hometown constituencies who feel they have not done enough to block the quickly accelerating moves of the second Trump administration.

Bush. He is widely expected to institute favorable policies for the crypto industry.\n\nPaul Atkins, the Trump administration’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, said regulation of crypto will be a top priority if confirmed as chairman.\nIn prepared remarks ahead of a confirmation hearing Thursday morning before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Atkins took aim at “ambiguous and non-existent” digital asset regulation that has hindered market growth.\n“Since 2017, as I have led industry efforts to develop best practices for the digital ass...\n\nLast week, during a confirmation hearing before the Senate, Atkins declared that creating a “regulatory foundation for digital assets” will be a top priority of his chairmanship.\n\nNotably, several Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee who previously embraced crypto legislation opposed Atkins’ nomination on Thursday.

    "full_content": "# Ronin Games 'Forgotten Runiverse' and 'Pixels' Team Up for PIXEL Collab\n\nCoin Prices\n\nAuthor: N/A | Date: Apr 3, 2025\n\nPixels and Forgotten Runiverse, a pair of crypto games on the gaming-focused Ethereum scaling network Ronin, are teaming up to bring Pixels’ PIXEL token to the Runiverse—the massively-multiplayer online role-playing game or MMORPG that just opened to the public in early access.\n\nForgotten Runiverse, developed by Biosonic, is based on the lore of the Ethereum NFT collection Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult. The game opted to move from layer-2 Arbitrum to Ronin in July 2024 and will eventually have its own native token, XP, which will act as the ecosystem token for Forgotten Runes.\n\nSocial farming game Pixels also made its own move to Ronin in late 2023, driving substantial renewed attention to the Ethereum network ahead of last year’s launch of the PIXEL token. Amid a recent push to open up Ronin to all builders, the two teams are now collaborating.\n\nRole-playing game Forgotten Runiverse has launched in early access on the Ronin Network, allowing users to master spells and earn rewards as they explore the open fantasy world based on the Ethereum NFT collection, Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult. \nThe launch is the culmination of three years of development work and more than 1 million hours of gameplay testing, according to a post by Ronin Network, the game’s new home after it opted to migrate from Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum last year. \n“W...\n\n“We’ve always seen a lot of potential synergy between our teams, as we both are focused on creating interoperable, sustainable Web3 economies, and we’re constantly thinking about how we can work together to push that vision forward,” Pixels founder Luke Barwikowski told Decrypt.\n\n“Honestly, if there’s one thing the industry needs right now, it’s more collaboration,” he added. “Ultimately, this is a win-win for all of us.”\n\nThanks to the collaboration, Runiverse players will be able to claim PIXEL rewards with Quanta—the in-game currency of the Forgotten Runiverse. PIXEL will also be used for purchasing mana, boosts, and exclusive items within the game.\n\n“By integrating PIXEL into the Runiverse, we’re offering players the chance to engage with a proven token economy inside a new game,” Biosonic COO Shane Bierwith told Decrypt. “This not only adds immediate utility for PIXEL, but also strengthens our own ecosystem as we prepare to launch our native token, XP.”\n\nThe teams expect that the integration will not only enhance token utility for PIXEL, but also “offer valuable data to optimize player engagement and play-to-earn strategies.”\n\n“Success, for us, comes down to the data,” said Barwikowski. “We’re all about using big data, AI, and predictive analytics to refine our play-to-earn models and boost reward efficiency.”\n\nThe team behind popular Ethereum farming game Pixels announced Monday that it will publish a new spinoff game called Pixel Dungeons, which serves up dungeon-based combat and lets players earn the same familiar PIXEL token.\nThe new game, developed in partnership with Crack and Stack, introduces a fast-paced competitive setting where players navigate dangerous dungeons, collect crypto rewards, and battle opponents. Players have two minutes to mine PIXEL tokens, use TNT to defeat goblins, and avoid...\n\n“Partnering with Forgotten Runiverse allows us to dive deep into player behavior, optimize our P2E systems, and ultimately improve retention and engagement,” he continued. “By building more insights through this partnership, we aim to develop strategies and data points that we can take to additional teams in the future.”\n\nBierwith too will be analyzing the data, telling Decrypt that Biosonic will measure “how effectively PIXEL drives repeat engagement, retention, and meaningful in-game spend,” including how many users swap Quanta into PIXEL and how it’s used in the game’s gacha-style rewards system called the Font of Memory.\n\nTo commemorate the collaboration, Runiverse-themed quests will launch in Pixels, plus a special Runiverse avatar will be available prior to the official launch of PIXEL in the fantasy MMORPG. That token integration is expected to take place sometime this quarter.\n\nThe makers of seminal play-to-earn game Axie Infinity just announced the franchise’s new massively multiplayer online—or MMO—game, Axie Infinity: Atia’s Legacy.

The game opted to move from layer-2 Arbitrum to Ronin in July 2024 and will eventually have its own native token, XP, which will act as the ecosystem token for Forgotten Runes.\n\nSocial farming game Pixels also made its own move to Ronin in late 2023, driving substantial renewed attention to the Ethereum network ahead of last year’s launch of the PIXEL token. Amid a recent push to open up Ronin to all builders, the two teams are now collaborating.\n\nRole-playing game Forgotten Runiverse has launched in early access on the Ronin Network, allowing users to master spells and earn rewards as they explore the open fantasy world based on the Ethereum NFT collection, Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult. \nThe launch is the culmination of three years of development work and more than 1 million hours of gameplay testing, according to a post by Ronin Network, the game’s new home after it opted to migrate from Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum last year. \n“W...\n\n“We’ve always seen a lot of potential synergy between our teams, as we both are focused on creating interoperable, sustainable Web3 economies, and we’re constantly thinking about how we can work together to push that vision forward,” Pixels founder Luke Barwikowski told Decrypt.\n\n“Honestly, if there’s one thing the industry needs right now, it’s more collaboration,” he added. “Ultimately, this is a win-win for all of us.”\n\nThanks to the collaboration, Runiverse players will be able to claim PIXEL rewards with Quanta—the in-game currency of the Forgotten Runiverse. PIXEL will also be used for purchasing mana, boosts, and exclusive items within the game.\n\n“By integrating PIXEL into the Runiverse, we’re offering players the chance to engage with a proven token economy inside a new game,” Biosonic COO Shane Bierwith told Decrypt. “This not only adds immediate utility for PIXEL, but also strengthens our own ecosystem as we prepare to launch our native token, XP.”\n\nThe teams expect that the integration will not only enhance token utility for PIXEL, but also “offer valuable data to optimize player engagement and play-to-earn strategies.”\n\n“Success, for us, comes down to the data,” said Barwikowski. “We’re all about using big data, AI, and predictive analytics to refine our play-to-earn models and boost reward efficiency.”\n\nThe team behind popular Ethereum farming game Pixels announced Monday that it will publish a new spinoff game called Pixel Dungeons, which serves up dungeon-based combat and lets players earn the same familiar PIXEL token.\nThe new game, developed in partnership with Crack and Stack, introduces a fast-paced competitive setting where players navigate dangerous dungeons, collect crypto rewards, and battle opponents.

That token integration is expected to take place sometime this quarter.\n\nThe makers of seminal play-to-earn game Axie Infinity just announced the franchise’s new massively multiplayer online—or MMO—game, Axie Infinity: Atia’s Legacy.

In fact, the token and company were both created by the FBI as part of a sting operation targeting wash trading.\n\nA UAE-based self-styled crypto market maker has admitted to orchestrating an elaborate wash trading scheme that fooled U.S. investors by generating millions in fake trading volume through automated self-dealing on Uniswap.\nCLS Global is expected to plead guilty to market manipulation and wire fraud charges after falling for an FBI sting operation, federal prosecutors in Boston announced Wednesday.\nUnder the plea agreement, CLS Global is required to pay penalties and forfeited assets exceeding $4...\n\nCLS Global, with a staff of 50 employed individuals, is based in the United Arab Emirates but works with cryptocurrencies available to investors inside the United States.\n\nThe company pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit market manipulation and wire fraud and one count of wire fraud in January 2025. In a statement, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts noted that a remaining defendant in the case is presumed innocent “unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.”\n\nIn a series of videoconferences, an employee of the firm revealed that the firm employed an algorithm that, “basically does self-trades,” making cryptocurrency trades from multiple wallets in an effort to mimic “organic buying and selling.”\n\nThe employee went on to say, “I know that it’s wash trading and I know people might not be happy about it.”\n\n$82,112.00\n\n$1,789.12\n\n$2.05\n\n$588.95\n\n$0.999889\n\n$115.28\n\n$0.159076\n\n$0.638981\n\n$0.235826\n\n$1,786.92\n\n$81,991.00\n\n$3.59\n\n$9.40\n\n$12.65\n\n$0.999913\n\n$0.257398\n\n$2,141.18\n\n$18.14\n\n$2.24\n\n$0.00001222\n\n$0.161088\n\n$82.19\n\n$6.40\n\n$4.03\n\n$295.06\n\n$4.47\n\n$0.999087\n\n$0.999023\n\n$1,789.46\n\n$1,902.73\n\n$27.56\n\n$0.577905\n\n$210.43\n\n$11.51\n\n$5.75\n\n$5.03\n\n$1.046\n\n$2.46\n\n$0.00000659\n\n$46.02\n\n$82,109.00\n\n$33.40\n\n$21.60\n\n$0.094939\n\n$0.795067\n\n$0.742915\n\n$5.08\n\n$15.96\n\n$0.994841\n\n$1.17\n\n$150.45\n\n$4.52\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.02152941\n\n$9.09\n\n$208.29\n\n$82,134.00\n\n$2.69\n\n$4.04\n\n$3.26\n\n$0.063727\n\n$0.310852\n\n$0.187351\n\n$2.73\n\n$0.174883\n\n$0.465085\n\n$0.304329\n\n$10.32\n\n$81,650.00\n\n$0.819859\n\n$0.428244\n\n$0.682652\n\n$4.24\n\n$1,787.71\n\n$0.378968\n\n$1,252.14\n\n$1,859.89\n\n$1.043\n\n$0.065168\n\n$68.14\n\n$1.001\n\n$120.17\n\n$0.380018\n\n$0.746251\n\n$2,023.19\n\n$0.578011\n\n$15.26\n\n$0.997531\n\n$0.999374\n\n$0.0000109\n\n$0.46675\n\n$0.999839\n\n$8.32\n\n$0.01315542\n\n$0.16209\n\n$0.082123\n\n$0.777793\n\n$3,122.03\n\n$0.999025\n\n$81,655.00\n\n$0.810555\n\n$588.14\n\n$1,898.47\n\n$3,123.52\n\n$0.537563\n\n$0.512906\n\n$0.643496\n\n$82,139.00\n\n$5.99\n\n$0.01470664\n\n$0.259787\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.00000063\n\n$1.97\n\n$0.103701\n\n$37.90\n\n$30.10\n\n$0.160724\n\n$0.364034\n\n$147.30\n\n$1.00\n\n$1,863.73\n\n$1.81\n\n$0.999128\n\n$0.00005436\n\n$1.80\n\n$2.77\n\n$0.99727\n\n$14.88\n\n$126.98\n\n$0.0688\n\n$0.131007\n\n$0.00981856\n\n$0.6107\n\n$0.999762\n\n$1.00\n\n$80,364.00\n\n$2.88\n\n$6.04\n\n$1.00\n\n$1.65\n\n$27.33\n\n$0.238013\n\n$0.442145\n\n$0.407694\n\n$1,899.84\n\n$2.67\n\n$0.00000043\n\n$0.00463174\n\n$15.02\n\n$47.06\n\n$82,055.00\n\n$83,052.00\n\n$0.664087\n\n$0.158826\n\n$0.999209\n\n$110.54\n\n$1,790.54\n\n$0.430225\n\n$0.087455\n\n$1,789.64\n\n$0.078406\n\n$1.047\n\n$0.387373\n\n$1.10\n\n$0.133164\n\n$0.00001944\n\n$1,787.61\n\n$0.04048694\n\n$1.088\n\n$5.74\n\n$0.374518\n\n$81,943.00\n\n$1,867.10\n\n$0.178152\n\n$0.548366\n\n$0.00634851\n\n$0.436026\n\n$0.998783\n\n$0.130653\n\n$0.998076\n\n$0.817167\n\n$0.0064796\n\n$0.187623\n\n$4.66\n\n$1,787.35\n\n$0.998688\n\n$0.340943\n\n$1,786.80\n\n$0.00000156\n\n$0.390838\n\n$0.00005798\n\n$0.031183\n\n$1.47\n\n$116.01\n\n$2.69\n\n$0.00474743\n\n$0.52154\n\n$1.003\n\n$0.999157\n\n$0.00887269\n\n$0.02958044\n\n$0.00346393\n\n$3.70\n\n$82,850.00\n\n$1,762.97\n\n$1.13\n\n$0.225642\n\n$1,787.68\n\n$2.83\n\n$81,889.00\n\n$1.11\n\n$0.525541\n\n$3,107.32\n\n$0.592973\n\n$0.222737\n\n$21.27\n\n$0.183585\n\n$1,888.99\n\n$1,957.26\n\n$0.00274827\n\n$14.95\n\n$0.116682\n\n$1,946.03\n\n$0.02960379\n\n$21.11\n\n$0.231775\n\n$1,646.50\n\n$0.099772\n\n$0.927191\n\n$1,774.40\n\n$0.00299414\n\n$0.060686\n\n$0.03228429\n\n$0.648788\n\n$0.01096908\n\n$0.513235\n\n$0.995352\n\n$0.470324\n\n$0.999481\n\n$0.00205854\n\n$81,900.00\n\n$0.999249\n\n$0.00442088\n\n$0.260501\n\n$18.12\n\n$1.00\n\n$0.02613897\n\nA UAE-based self-styled crypto market maker has admitted to orchestrating an elaborate wash trading scheme that fooled U.S. investors by generating millions in fake trading volume through automated self-dealing on Uniswap.\nCLS Global is expected to plead guilty to market manipulation and wire fraud charges after falling for an FBI sting operation, federal prosecutors in Boston announced Wednesday.\nUnder the plea agreement, CLS Global is required to pay penalties and forfeited assets exceeding $4...\n\nOne of the largest pedophile platforms in the world has been shut down after an international investigation, with crypto widely used as a payment method for images of child sexual abuse.\n\"Kidflix\" resembled a streaming service—and according to Europol, 1.8 million users worldwide had logged on to the site between April 2022 and March of this year.\nDetectives have identified 1,275 people who either purchased child sexual assault material using digital assets, or earned credits by uploading their...\n\nA $400 million crypto payday tied to the Trump family is now the focus of an escalating political firestorm, one that lawmakers say could compromise the integrity of U.S. financial regulation.\nOn April 2, Sen.
