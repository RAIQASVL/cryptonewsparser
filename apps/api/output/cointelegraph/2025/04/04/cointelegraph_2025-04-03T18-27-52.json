    "description": "Opinion by: Rob Viglione, co-founder and CEO of Horizen LabsCan you trust your AI to be unbiased? A recent research paper suggests it&rsquo;s a little more complicated. Unfortunately, bias isn&rsquo;t just a bug &mdash; it&rsquo;s a persistent feature without proper cryptographic guardrails.A September 2024 study from Imperial College London shows how zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can help companies verify that their machine learning (ML) models treat all demographic groups equally while still keeping model details and user data private.&nbsp;Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods that enable one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the statement&rsquo;s validity. When defining &ldquo;fairness,&rdquo; however, we open up a whole new can of worms.&nbsp;Machine learning biasWith machine learning models, bias manifests in dramatically different ways. It can cause a credit scoring service to rate a person differently based on their friends&rsquo; and communities&rsquo; credit scores, which can be inherently discriminatory. It can also prompt AI image generators to show the Pope and Ancient Greeks as people of different races, like Google&rsquo;s AI tool Gemini infamously did last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spotting an unfair machine learning (ML) model in the wild is easy. If the model is depriving people of loans or credit because of who their friends are, that&rsquo;s discrimination. If it&rsquo;s revising history or treating specific demographics differently to overcorrect in the name of equity, that&rsquo;s also discrimination. Both scenarios undermine trust in these systems.Consider a bank using an ML model for loan approvals. A ZKP could prove that the model isn&rsquo;t biased against any demographic without exposing sensitive customer data or proprietary model details. With ZK and ML, banks could prove they&rsquo;re not systematically discriminating against a racial group. That proof would be real-time and continuous versus today&rsquo;s inefficient government audits of private data.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal ML model? One that doesn&rsquo;t revise history or treat people differently based on their background. AI must adhere to anti-discrimination laws like the American Civil Rights Act of 1964. The problem lies in baking that into AI and making it verifiable.&nbsp;ZKPs offer the technical pathway to guarantee this adherence.AI is biased (but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be)When dealing with machine learning, we need to be sure that any attestations of fairness keep the underlying ML models and training data confidential. They need to protect intellectual property and users&rsquo; privacy while providing enough access for users to know that their model is not discriminatory.&nbsp;Not an easy task. ZKPs offer a verifiable solution.&nbsp;ZKML (zero knowledge machine learning) is how we use zero-knowledge proofs to verify that an ML model is what it says on the box. ZKML combines zero-knowledge cryptography with machine learning to create systems that can verify AI properties without exposing the underlying models or data. We can also take that concept and use ZKPs to identify ML models that treat everyone equally and fairly.&nbsp;Recent: Know Your Peer &mdash; The pros and cons of KYCPreviously, using ZKPs to prove AI fairness was extremely limited because it could only focus on one phase of the ML pipeline. This made it possible for dishonest model providers to construct data sets that would satisfy the fairness requirements, even if the model failed to do so. The ZKPs would also introduce unrealistic computational demands and long wait times to produce proofs of fairness.In recent months, ZK frameworks have made it possible to scale ZKPs to determine the end-to-end fairness of models with tens of millions of parameters and to do so provably securely.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trillion-dollar question: How do we measure whether an AI is fair?Let&rsquo;s break down three of the most common group fairness definitions: demographic parity, equality of opportunity and predictive equality.&nbsp;Demographic parity means that the probability of a specific prediction is the same across different groups, such as race or sex. Diversity, equity and inclusion departments often use it as a measurement to attempt to reflect the demographics of a population within a company&rsquo;s workforce. It&rsquo;s not the ideal fairness metric for ML models because expecting that every group will have the same outcomes is unrealistic.Equality of opportunity is easy for most people to understand. It gives every group the same chance to have a positive outcome, assuming they are equally qualified. It is not optimizing for outcomes &mdash; only that every demographic should have the same opportunity to get a job or a home loan.&nbsp;Likewise, predictive equality measures if an ML model makes predictions with the same accuracy across various demographics, so no one is penalized simply for being part of a group.&nbsp;In both cases, the ML model is not putting its thumb on the scale for equity reasons but only to ensure that groups are not being discriminated against in any way. This is an eminently sensible fix.Fairness is becoming the standard, one way or anotherOver the past year, the US government and other countries have issued statements and mandates around AI fairness and protecting the public from ML bias. Now, with a new administration in the US, AI fairness will likely be approached differently, returning the focus to equality of opportunity and away from equity.&nbsp;As political landscapes shift, so do fairness definitions in AI, moving between equity-focused and opportunity-focused paradigms. We welcome ML models that treat everyone equally without putting thumbs on the scale. Zero-knowledge proofs can serve as an airtight way to verify ML models are doing this without revealing private data.&nbsp;&nbsp;While ZKPs have faced plenty of scalability challenges over the years, the technology is finally becoming affordable for mainstream use cases. We can use ZKPs to verify training data integrity, protect privacy, and ensure the models we&rsquo;re using are what they say they are.&nbsp;As ML models become more interwoven in our daily lives and our future job prospects, college admissions and mortgages depend on them, we could use a little more reassurance that AI treats us fairly.

ZKML combines zero-knowledge cryptography with machine learning to create systems that can verify AI properties without exposing the underlying models or data. We can also take that concept and use ZKPs to identify ML models that treat everyone equally and fairly.&nbsp;Recent: Know Your Peer &mdash; The pros and cons of KYCPreviously, using ZKPs to prove AI fairness was extremely limited because it could only focus on one phase of the ML pipeline. This made it possible for dishonest model providers to construct data sets that would satisfy the fairness requirements, even if the model failed to do so. The ZKPs would also introduce unrealistic computational demands and long wait times to produce proofs of fairness.In recent months, ZK frameworks have made it possible to scale ZKPs to determine the end-to-end fairness of models with tens of millions of parameters and to do so provably securely.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trillion-dollar question: How do we measure whether an AI is fair?Let&rsquo;s break down three of the most common group fairness definitions: demographic parity, equality of opportunity and predictive equality.&nbsp;Demographic parity means that the probability of a specific prediction is the same across different groups, such as race or sex. Diversity, equity and inclusion departments often use it as a measurement to attempt to reflect the demographics of a population within a company&rsquo;s workforce. It&rsquo;s not the ideal fairness metric for ML models because expecting that every group will have the same outcomes is unrealistic.Equality of opportunity is easy for most people to understand. It gives every group the same chance to have a positive outcome, assuming they are equally qualified. It is not optimizing for outcomes &mdash; only that every demographic should have the same opportunity to get a job or a home loan.&nbsp;Likewise, predictive equality measures if an ML model makes predictions with the same accuracy across various demographics, so no one is penalized simply for being part of a group.&nbsp;In both cases, the ML model is not putting its thumb on the scale for equity reasons but only to ensure that groups are not being discriminated against in any way. This is an eminently sensible fix.Fairness is becoming the standard, one way or anotherOver the past year, the US government and other countries have issued statements and mandates around AI fairness and protecting the public from ML bias. Now, with a new administration in the US, AI fairness will likely be approached differently, returning the focus to equality of opportunity and away from equity.&nbsp;As political landscapes shift, so do fairness definitions in AI, moving between equity-focused and opportunity-focused paradigms. We welcome ML models that treat everyone equally without putting thumbs on the scale. Zero-knowledge proofs can serve as an airtight way to verify ML models are doing this without revealing private data.&nbsp;&nbsp;While ZKPs have faced plenty of scalability challenges over the years, the technology is finally becoming affordable for mainstream use cases. We can use ZKPs to verify training data integrity, protect privacy, and ensure the models we&rsquo;re using are what they say they are.&nbsp;As ML models become more interwoven in our daily lives and our future job prospects, college admissions and mortgages depend on them, we could use a little more reassurance that AI treats us fairly. Whether we can all agree on the definition of fairness, however, is another question entirely.Opinion by: Rob Viglione, co-founder and CEO of Horizen Labs.

The world changes, and we have to decide what that means for Bitcoin today.&rdquo;The discussion highlights how some proposed upgrades aren&rsquo;t new but were initially removed as a precaution. Now, with Bitcoin&rsquo;s maturity, developers are considering reinstating them to improve functionality.&nbsp;&ldquo;Bitcoin is in the hands of its users,&rdquo; Spears emphasizes. &ldquo;We get to decide what it should be, just as much as those who were there 15 years ago.&rdquo;As Bitcoin continues to evolve, The Clear Crypto Podcast cuts through the noise to deliver insightful conversations about where it&rsquo;s headed next.&nbsp;To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,&nbsp; listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph&rsquo;s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

The best ideas need to rise to the surface,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The Next Chapter of Treasure &#10024;We're releasing an official statement on our pivotal transition, outlining the rationale behind leadership changes, financial restructuring, and our bold new strategic direction.Full details &#128071; pic.twitter.com/BjWgZxc98l&mdash; Treasure (@Treasure_DAO) April 2, 2025As part of cost-cutting to reduce Treasure DAO's annual burn rate of $8.3 million, Patten says 15 contributors have either left or been laid off, and game publishing support and the treasure chain will be terminated.&nbsp;At the same time, he is proposing to withdraw an idle $785,000 from the market maker Flowdesk to increase the DAO&rsquo;s treasury.Patten says that, with the current runway, &ldquo;stablecoins will last until roughly December,&rdquo; but if the DAO approves withdrawing the funds from Flowdesk, this could be extended to February 2026, in &ldquo;an optimistic scenario.&rdquo;The DAO's current treasury only has $2.4 million left, and the ecosystem fund holds 22.3 million MAGIC, valued at $2.3 million, according to Patten, but if &ldquo;Magic falls,&rdquo; the DAO is &ldquo;unsustainable sometime between December and February.&rdquo; Treasure DAO to refocus on four products Patten says the DAO also needs to focus its energy on a few key products and future partnerships will be based on revenue generation for the DAO, where users of the platform will need to generate value through token use.&ldquo;The DAO should officially commit to a focused, streamlined approach of four products and four products only, the marketplace, Bridgeworld, Smolworld and AI agent, scaling technology,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Related: Illuvium CEO says firm has gone &lsquo;super lean&rsquo; to speed up development&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all that Treasure should be through 2025. Bridgeworld and Smolworld will be use cases to demonstrate how other projects utilize magic marketplace and our AI framework and back end to run many, many agents concurrently.&rdquo;TreasureDAO, launched in 2021, offered services to provide game publishers access to infrastructure and advisory services to launch Web3-based games.&nbsp;However, Patten says it &ldquo;didn't have a scalable business model&rdquo; and hasn&rsquo;t grown since the Arbitrum airdrop in March 2023.&nbsp;The Treasure ecosystem token MAGIC is down 16.5% to $0.0872 for the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Overall, the token has shed 98% after hitting its all-time high of $6.32 on Feb. 19, 2022.&nbsp;Magazine: Financial nihilism in crypto is over &mdash; It&rsquo;s time to dream big again"

Meanwhile, CoinGecko data&nbsp;shows&nbsp;Ether (ETH) dropped over 6% from $1,934 to $1,797 following the tariff announcements and the total crypto market cap&nbsp;dropped&nbsp;5.3% to $2.7 trillion.&nbsp;The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, returned a score of 25, classed as extreme fear, in its latest April 2 update.&nbsp;However, prices have clawed back some losses since. Bitcoin has recovered 0.8% to $83,205.

    "description": "Two Democratic lawmakers in the US Senate and House of Representatives have called on acting Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mark Uyeda to preserve information regarding World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm backed by President Donald Trump&rsquo;s family.In an April 2 letter, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters &mdash; ranking members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, respectively &mdash; asked Uyeda to provide information to Congress based on Trump&rsquo;s ties to World Liberty Financial (WLFI). The two lawmakers suggested the SEC may be being influenced by the firm, and &ldquo;this conflict of interest may be interfering with its mission to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets.&rdquo;&ldquo;The Trump family&rsquo;s financial stake in World Liberty Financial represents an unprecedented conflict of interest with the potential to influence the Trump Administration&rsquo;s oversight &mdash; or lack thereof &mdash; of the cryptocurrency industry, creating an obvious incentive for the Trump Administration to direct federal agencies, including the SEC, to take positions favorable to cryptocurrency interests that directly benefit the President's family,&rdquo; said the letter.April 2 letter to acting SEC chair Mark Uyeda.

    "title": "Twitter User Claims TradingView Has Ignored a Fibonacci Retracement Bug for 5 Years",
    "description": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken. Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&rdquo; However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug. As Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the &ldquo;CIX100&rdquo; index &mdash; an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens. At the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes. As of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment.",
