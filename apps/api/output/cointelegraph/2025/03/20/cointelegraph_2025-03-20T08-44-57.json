    "description": "Bitcoin is unlikely to revisit the $77,000 price level anytime soon after the Fed signaled a slowdown in quantitative tightening (QT), says BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.On March 10, Bitcoin (BTC) dipped near the $77,000 level for the first time since November, according to CoinMarketCap data.&ldquo;Was BTC $77k the bottom, prob,&rdquo; Hayes said in a March 20 X post after declaring that QT is &ldquo;basically over&rdquo; following the Fed&rsquo;s March 19 announcement that starting in April, it will slow its securities sell-off by reducing the monthly Treasury cap from $25 billion to $5 billion.&nbsp;Bitcoin is up 3.53% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCapThis could ease liquidity pressures and support risk assets like Bitcoin, as QT involves central banks selling assets to reduce the money supply and possibly raise interest rates.&nbsp;&ldquo;The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE,&rdquo; Hayes added.The Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption was a temporary rule during the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed banks to exclude US Treasury securities from their SLR calculations. Meanwhile, quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy that aims to stimulate the economy and encourage more spending.Echoing a similar sentiment to Hayes, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts said in a March 19 X post that &ldquo;QT is effectively dead.&rdquo; Coutts explained that &ldquo;treasury volatility&rdquo; has calmed down following the US dollar's drop earlier this month, a positive signal for boosting liquidity.Other optimists included Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff &ldquo;JiHo&rdquo; Zirlin, who said the Fed slowdown is &ldquo;great for both crypto and equity markets.&rdquo;&ldquo;The Fed has significant leeway to loosen up, providing more support for businesses + markets,&rdquo; Zirlin said, while Bitcoin venture capitalist Mark Moss said that with QT ending, &ldquo;the dam is going to break.&rdquo;Related: Bitcoin risks new 'death cross&rsquo; as BTC price tackles $84K resistanceMeanwhile, crypto market sentiment has spiked following the Fed&rsquo;s comments.&nbsp;The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall sentiment, has moved into &ldquo;Neutral&rdquo; territory at 49 after lingering in the &ldquo;Fear&rdquo; area since Feb. 26.Despite Bitcoin being down nearly 22% from its January $109,000 all-time highs, Infinex founder Kain Warwick told Cointelegraph that it is a &ldquo;normal mid-bull correction.&rdquo;&ldquo;I would need to see a much larger breakdown to flip bearish,&rdquo; Warwick said. &ldquo;My baseline thesis is the four-year cycle holds once again, which means we keep grinding up through the rest of the year.&rdquo;Magazine: Classic Sega, Atari and Nintendo games get crypto makeovers: Web3 GamerThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: CoinMarketCapThis could ease liquidity pressures and support risk assets like Bitcoin, as QT involves central banks selling assets to reduce the money supply and possibly raise interest rates.&nbsp;&ldquo;The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE,&rdquo; Hayes added.The Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption was a temporary rule during the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed banks to exclude US Treasury securities from their SLR calculations. Meanwhile, quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy that aims to stimulate the economy and encourage more spending.Echoing a similar sentiment to Hayes, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts said in a March 19 X post that &ldquo;QT is effectively dead.&rdquo; Coutts explained that &ldquo;treasury volatility&rdquo; has calmed down following the US dollar's drop earlier this month, a positive signal for boosting liquidity.Other optimists included Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff &ldquo;JiHo&rdquo; Zirlin, who said the Fed slowdown is &ldquo;great for both crypto and equity markets.&rdquo;&ldquo;The Fed has significant leeway to loosen up, providing more support for businesses + markets,&rdquo; Zirlin said, while Bitcoin venture capitalist Mark Moss said that with QT ending, &ldquo;the dam is going to break.&rdquo;Related: Bitcoin risks new 'death cross&rsquo; as BTC price tackles $84K resistanceMeanwhile, crypto market sentiment has spiked following the Fed&rsquo;s comments.&nbsp;The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall sentiment, has moved into &ldquo;Neutral&rdquo; territory at 49 after lingering in the &ldquo;Fear&rdquo; area since Feb. 26.Despite Bitcoin being down nearly 22% from its January $109,000 all-time highs, Infinex founder Kain Warwick told Cointelegraph that it is a &ldquo;normal mid-bull correction.&rdquo;&ldquo;I would need to see a much larger breakdown to flip bearish,&rdquo; Warwick said. &ldquo;My baseline thesis is the four-year cycle holds once again, which means we keep grinding up through the rest of the year.&rdquo;Magazine: Classic Sega, Atari and Nintendo games get crypto makeovers: Web3 GamerThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The executive told Cointelegraph:&ldquo;The US really has to push its other two advantages of a very strong domestic market and the ability for it to create these highly reliable financial assets. And this is what I think the administration and the people in the legislature are now starting to understand.&rdquo;Real-world tokenized assets could become a $100-trillion market in the coming years, as the world&rsquo;s assets come onchain, the Chainlink executive predicted.Sergey Nazarov takes part in a panel at the 2025 Digital Asset Summit.

It&rsquo;s also taking place in the United Arab Emirates, which is considered one of the hottest property markets in the world. Proactive digital asset regulations are driving a tokenized RWA boom in the Gulf state as institutional investors and developers flock to tokenization as an alternative method of capital formation.Magazine: Real life yield farming: How tokenization is transforming lives in Africa"

    "title": "Twitter User Claims TradingView Has Ignored a Fibonacci Retracement Bug for 5 Years",
    "description": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken. Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&rdquo; However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug. As Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the &ldquo;CIX100&rdquo; index &mdash; an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens. At the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes. As of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment.",
