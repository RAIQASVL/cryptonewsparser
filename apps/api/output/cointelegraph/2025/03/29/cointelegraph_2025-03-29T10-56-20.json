There&rsquo;s reason to believe that the video game retailer could make a big splash, given its corporate cash balance of nearly $4.8 billion. This is a notable jump from one year earlier when the company&rsquo;s balance sheet was around $922 million.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s also reason to believe that GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was orange-pilled by Michael Saylor after the two met in early February.

This approach seems to have worked for Strategy, Michael Saylor&rsquo;s business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin bank. Strategy has now amassed more than 500,000 BTC through successive purchases.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewHayes wrote in a March 24 X post:&ldquo;I bet $BTC hits $110k before it retests $76.5k. Y? The Fed is going from QT to QE for treasuries. And tariffs don&rsquo;t matter cause of &ldquo;transitory inflation.&rdquo; JAYPOW told me so.&rdquo;Source: Arthur Hayes&ldquo;What I mean is that the price is more likely to hit $110k than $76.5k next. If we hit $110k, then it&rsquo;s yachtzee time and we ain&rsquo;t looking back until $250k,&rdquo; Hayes added in a follow-up X post.Quantitative tightening (QT) is when the US Federal Reserve shrinks its balance sheet by selling bonds or letting them mature without reinvesting proceeds, while quantitative easing (QE) means that the Fed is buying bonds and pumping money into the economy to lower interest rates and encourage spending during difficult financial conditions.Other analysts pointed out that while the Fed has slowed QT, it has not yet fully pivoted to easing.&ldquo;QT is not &lsquo;basically over&rsquo; on April 1st. They still have $35B/mo coming off from mortgage backed securities. They just slowed QT from $60B/mo to $40B/mo,&rdquo; according to Benjamin Cowen, founder and CEO of IntoTheCryptoVerse.Continue readingHyperliquid whale still holds 10% of JELLY memecoin after $6.2 million exploitA crypto whale who allegedly manipulated the price of the Jelly my Jelly (JELLY) memecoin on decentralized exchange Hyperliquid still holds nearly $2 million worth of the token, according to blockchain analysts.The unidentified whale made at least $6.26 million in profit by exploiting the liquidation parameters on Hyperliquid.According to a postmortem report by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, the whale opened three large trading positions within five minutes: two long positions worth $2.15 million and $1.9 million and a $4.1 million short position that effectively offset the longs.Source: ArkhamWhen the price of JELLY rose by 400%, the $4 million short position wasn&rsquo;t immediately liquidated due to its size.

Let&rsquo;s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin turned down from the resistance line and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($85,765) on March 28.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price below the immediate support at $83,000. If they do that, the BTC/USDT pair could slide to $81,000 and later to $80,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $76,606 and $80,000.The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the resistance line to signal that the correction may be ending. A close above the 50-day simple moving average ($89,346) could propel the pair to $95,000 and eventually to the psychological resistance at $100,000.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) turned down from the breakdown level of $2,111 and broke below the 20-day EMA ($2,032), indicating that the bears remain in control.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers will try to sink the ETH/USDT pair to the $1,800 to $1,754 support zone. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the zone because a break below it could resume the downtrend.

The judge overseeing the case agreed with Terraform Labs&rsquo; bankruptcy plan, calling it a &ldquo;welcome alternative&rdquo; to further litigation over investor losses.

Manual evidence includes transaction logs, account statements, and screenshots. Preferred evidence refers to read-only API keys.

In his purge of the US government, he has allegedly fired thousands of federal workers, most of whom were ordered to be reinstated after a judge&rsquo;s order on March 13. It&rsquo;s unclear whether the DOGE team has the same plans for the SEC.Cointelegraph spoke to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who declined to comment on the report or confirm if she had received a similar email. Cointelegraph contacted Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Is new leadership coming to the SEC?The US Senate Banking Committee will likely soon take a vote on whether to advance the nomination of Paul Atkins, Trump&rsquo;s pick to chair the SEC. At a March 27 confirmation hearing, Atkins said he would &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; be willing to work with DOGE if confirmed as an SEC commissioner. Lawmakers also questioned his potential conflicts of interest with the crypto industry. Magazine: SEC&rsquo;s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered"

    "description": "Key takeawaysBitcoin is legal in Australia and is regulated by AUSTRAC and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).&nbsp;You can buy Bitcoin on various platforms, including centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), P2P platforms and Bitcoin ATMsPayment options are diverse, including credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers and fiat cash deposits at ATMsStore your Bitcoin securely and opt for cold wallets, which protect you better than custodial wallets from crypto exchanges.&nbsp;Bitcoin adoption continues to grow. More and more Australians are discovering the cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle, with ownership rising from 23% in 2023 to 32.5% in 2025, an impressive 41.3% increase. Because there are several platforms to choose from, buying Bitcoin is low-threshold and secure.&nbsp;This article covers several methods and describes the steps to safely start investing in Bitcoin.&nbsp;Is Bitcoin legal in Australia?Yes, Bitcoin is legal in Australia, but it&rsquo;s not considered a legal tender. The local government considers owning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as property. Any profit you might make from Bitcoin is subject to capital gains tax (CGT), with Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) ensuring AML and CTF compliance.Of course, there are also various regulatory requirements to abide by. AUSTRAC requires cryptocurrency companies to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism-financing (CTF) regulations. This framework aims to protect Australian investors by safeguarding the crypto market against financial crime.A significant update in 2025 requires major crypto platforms to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) for enhanced consumer protection, as outlined in government proposals.Did you know? Some Australian exchanges offer instant verification, allowing you to start trading Bitcoin within minutes.Prerequisites to buying Bitcoin in AustraliaBefore buying Bitcoin in Australia, it is essential to prepare properly.

Bitcoin adoption in Australia has been rising recently, leading many Australians to deploy cryptocurrency to diversify their investment portfolios.&nbsp;How to buy Bitcoin in Australia via P2P platformsIn Australia, you have peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency platforms such as Binance P2P to buy Bitcoin directly from other users, offering flexibility and privacy. Here&rsquo;s how you can buy Bitcoin on P2P platforms:Step 1: Create an account. Sign up and complete the KYC verification. Have your ID ready and verify your contact details during the process. Notably, Binance P2P, registered with AUSTRAC, ensures compliance with AML/CTF regulations, making it a reliable choice for Australians.Step 2: Search for Bitcoin offers. Browse available offers, filtering by payment method (e.g., bank transfer, PayID), price or seller reputation. Prioritize sellers with high feedback scores (e.g., 95%+ positive ratings) and a history of 100+ completed trades for trustworthiness. Binance P2P displays these metrics clearly. As of 2025, Binance P2P supports over 31 fiat currencies and 700+ payment methods globally, tailoring offers to Australian users.Step 3: Start a trade. Select the amount of Bitcoin or fiat currency you want to trade and click &ldquo;Buy.&rdquo;Step 4: Make the Payment. Pay via bank transfer, PayID or another accepted payment method. The platform holds the Bitcoin in escrow until the payment is confirmed. Notably, PayID transactions are instant and free on Binance P2P, while bank transfers may take 1-2 hours. Confirm receipt with the seller via the platform&rsquo;s messaging system to avoid delays.Step 5: Receive your Bitcoin: Once the seller verifies your payment, the escrowed Bitcoin is released to your P2P wallet (e.g., Binance wallet). This typically happens within minutes for instant methods like PayID.&nbsp;For maximum security, you could immediately transfer your BTC to a non-custodial wallet like Trust Wallet or a hardware wallet like Ledger. P2P platforms aren&rsquo;t designed for long-term storage.&nbsp;This P2P process offers a direct, flexible way to buy Bitcoin, with Binance P2P standing out in 2025 for its robust escrow system and wide payment options. Always double-check seller credibility and avoid off-platform payments to mitigate risks, aligning with best practices for P2P trading.How to buy Bitcoin in Australia using Bitcoin ATMsBy using a Bitcoin ATM, you can buy Bitcoin quickly and easily.

Because there are several platforms to choose from, buying Bitcoin is low-threshold and secure.&nbsp;This article covers several methods and describes the steps to safely start investing in Bitcoin.&nbsp;Is Bitcoin legal in Australia?Yes, Bitcoin is legal in Australia, but it&rsquo;s not considered a legal tender. The local government considers owning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as property. Any profit you might make from Bitcoin is subject to capital gains tax (CGT), with Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) ensuring AML and CTF compliance.Of course, there are also various regulatory requirements to abide by. AUSTRAC requires cryptocurrency companies to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism-financing (CTF) regulations. This framework aims to protect Australian investors by safeguarding the crypto market against financial crime.A significant update in 2025 requires major crypto platforms to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) for enhanced consumer protection, as outlined in government proposals.Did you know?

Always check the associated transaction fees so you don&rsquo;t incur unexpected (sometimes high) fees.&nbsp;Secure your investment: Take precautions for your security, too.

    "title": "Timeline: Jelly token goes sour after $6M exploit on Hyperliquid",
    "description": "Suspicious trading activity led decentralized exchange Hyperliquid to delist the Jelly-my-Jelly (JELLY) memecoin, with details of an exploit unraveling over the course of a few days.&nbsp;The decentralized finance sector has already seen historic exploits in 2025, as the space struggles with issues of oversight and security. The Bybit hack saw North Korean hackers get away with $1.4 billion in February alone.The JELLY incident, in which a whale exploited the Hyperliquid exchange&rsquo;s liquidation parameters, getting away with millions, is just the latest exploit to rock the industry.&nbsp;Observers roundly criticized Hyperliquid&rsquo;s reaction to the short squeeze, with one even comparing it to the ill-fated FTX. Here&rsquo;s a look at how the incident unfolded.Jelly token price crashes ahead of Hyperliquid exploitVenmo co-founder Iqram Magdon-Ismail launched the JELLY token as part of the JellyJelly Web3 social media project. Following the launch on Jan. 30, the token price crashed from $0.21 to just $0.01 some 10 days later.&nbsp;Jelly-my-Jelly token price lost most of its value in the first two weeks of trading. Source: CoinMarketCapWhile the coin&rsquo;s market cap initially boasted almost a quarter of a billion dollars, by March 26 it had a market cap of roughly $25 million.A short squeeze of JellyJellyThe short squeeze on the JellyJelly token took place over the course of just a few hours on March 26. According to a postmortem by Arkham Intelligence, this is how it went down:The exploiter deposited $7 million on three separate Hyperliquid accounts, making leveraged trades on the illiquid Jelly token.Two accounts took $2.15 million and $1.9 million long positions on JELLY, while the other took a $4.1 million short position to cancel the others out.As the price of JELLYJELLY increased, the short position was liquidated, but it was too large to be liquidated normally.The short position was passed to the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP).The exploiter meanwhile had a seven-figure PnL from which to withdraw. By this point, the price of JELLY had pumped 400%.The exploiter began to pull withdrawals but Hyperliquid soon restricted their accounts.

Source: F2B BROCCOLI communityThe F2B community also attempted to calculate the scores themselves based on the formula cited by BNB Chain in a Feb. 14 blog post, and again in a Feb. 18 X post:&ldquo;Score = (Market Cap Rank &times; 30%) + (24h Price Change Rank &times; 20%) + (24h Volume Rank &times; 50%)&rdquo;Under that rubric, F2B appeared to have a clear edge &mdash; 5.5 points compared to 714&rsquo;s 5.9 points.Related: BNB Chain flips Solana in daily fees, beats out all chainsBNB Chain claims score is legitIn a detailed response to the community inquiry shared with Cointelegraph, BNB Chain said that the community&rsquo;s calculations relied on deprecated metrics.

BNB Chain said the deprecated dimensions were removed on Feb. 21 to &ldquo;prevent miscalculations by the community.&rdquo; BNB Chain said the community relied on metrics that aren&rsquo;t part of the official ranking formula. Source: BNB ChainBNB Chain also dismissed concerns about the overly precise 5.70000001 score, saying it was simply a result of floating-point deviations caused by the IEEE 754 standard and held no reference value for the actual score.Despite the clarification, many in the F2B camp remain unconvinced, arguing that the rules lacked transparency and shifted mid-competition.Magazine: Bitcoiner sex trap extortion?

    "title": "Twitter User Claims TradingView Has Ignored a Fibonacci Retracement Bug for 5 Years",
    "description": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken. Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this.

Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this.
