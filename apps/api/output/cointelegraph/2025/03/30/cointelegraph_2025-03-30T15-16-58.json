    "title": "What are crypto-backed mortgages, and how do they work?",
    "description": "What are crypto-based mortgages? Crypto-backed mortgages are a kind of loan where borrowers use their cryptocurrency holdings, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH), as collateral to secure financing for real estate purchases. This approach allows you to access funds without selling your digital assets. By retaining crypto ownership, borrowers can still benefit from future price increases.There are various types of crypto-backed mortgages: purchase mortgages, cash-out refinancing and bridge loans.&nbsp;Purchase mortgages: These help you finance real estate using crypto as collateral.&nbsp;Cash-out refinancing: It allows you to refinance your existing mortgages by leveraging your crypto assets to access additional funds.&nbsp;Bridge loans: These loans provide short-term financing, helping you cover the period between purchasing a new property and selling an existing one.Crypto mortgages are particularly appealing if you want to preserve your holdings while securing real-world assets. However, you need to consider the volatility of cryptocurrencies and carefully assess the risks before opting for a crypto-backed mortgage.Lenders usually accept stablecoins such as Tether (USDt) and USDC (USDC) or major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Some lenders may accept a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies as collateral, which is known as cross-collateralization.Did you know? With traditional mortgages becoming increasingly difficult to obtain, particularly for younger individuals, alternative solutions are gaining traction. Fintech startups are addressing this demand by offering adjustable or fixed-rate mortgages secured by substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Crypto-based mortgages vs traditional mortgages Crypto-backed and traditional mortgages differ from eligibility requirements to risk factors. Traditional mortgages rely on credit history, income verification and down payments, while crypto-backed mortgages use digital assets as collateral.&nbsp;The approval process for crypto mortgages is often faster, but they come with higher interest rates and volatility risks. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties make crypto-backed loans less widely accepted in real estate markets. A comparison of the two mortgage types is given below: How do crypto-backed mortgages work? The basic mechanism of crypto-backed mortgages is that depositors calculate the value of the crypto the borrower proposes to collateralize and release a loan against the amount.&nbsp;To assess the value of the crypto assets, the lenders may apply a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which indicates the percentage of the collateral value you can borrow.&nbsp;For example, if the LTV ratio is 50%, you can secure a loan of $25,000 for collateralized crypto assets worth $50,000. Overcollateralization helps to create a buffer, which helps the lender if the value of the collateral goes down. Smart contracts are used to automate the execution of loan terms.&nbsp;Here is a step-by-step look at the functioning of crypto-backed mortgages:&nbsp;Step 1: Find a lender &ndash; Look for a financial institution or decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers crypto-backed mortgages. Compare different lenders based on their interest rates, fees and supported cryptocurrencies.Step 2: Apply and submit proof of ownership &ndash; Submit an application for getting a loan against the crypto you hold. You also need to provide proof of ownership of your digital assets. The lender will assess the worth of your crypto holdings to determine your borrowing limit. Some lenders may consider other financial factors, such as credit history.Step 3: Move crypto to escrow account &ndash; Once approved, you need to pledge the required amount of crypto by transferring it into an escrow account. This crypto acts as security for the mortgage loan.&nbsp;Step 4: Prep the loan &ndash; Complete the loan agreement, which outlines key terms like repayment schedules, interest rates and what happens if your collateral&rsquo;s value drops. Usually, if the value of the crypto drops, you will need to deposit more crypto in the escrow account so that the loan remains overcollateralized. If you fail to deposit additional crypto, the lender may liquidate your crypto deposits.Step 5: Disbursal of loan &ndash; The loan funds are typically disbursed in fiat currency for purchasing the property.Step 6: Make mortgage payments &ndash; Repay the loan according to the agreed terms. The interest rate may differ in line with the market value of the collateralized crypto.Step 7: Recover your collateral &ndash; If you complete all payments as per the loan agreement, you will get back your cryptocurrency from escrow. If you fail to repay it, the lender may liquidate your collateral to cover the outstanding amount.Did you know? Freddie Mac data shows that when fixed-rate mortgages were introduced in 1971, interest rates were about 7.5%. However, by 1980, they had dramatically increased to almost 20%. Benefits of crypto-backed mortgages Thanks to crypto-backed mortgages, you can access funds to invest in real estate without selling digital assets. You can leverage your crypto assets to take advantage of real estate market growth.&nbsp;Here are some key benefits of using a crypto-backed mortgage:Faster and simpler process: Compared to traditional mortgages, crypto-backed loans generally have a quicker and more streamlined approval process. Lenders use smart contracts to execute loan terms, making the whole process efficient and without prejudice.Liquidity without selling: You can access funds to invest in real estate without liquidating your crypto holdings. This is particularly beneficial during a real estate market upswing as you can retain your crypto assets while securing finances for real estate investment.Investment growth potential: Crypto-backed mortgages enable you to enjoy double growth. You benefit from appreciation in the prices of the real estate and the growth of your crypto assets.Broader accessibility: Crypto-backed mortgages provide financing opportunities for anyone who lacks traditional credit histories. If you have just settled in a country and don&rsquo;t have financial records there, crypto-backed loans become a viable option.&nbsp;Tax benefits: Since no assets are sold, you can avoid immediate capital gains tax. This allows you to access value without triggering taxable events. Challenges in crypto-backed mortgages While crypto-backed mortgages offer some unique advantages, they also come with several challenges you must consider. From price volatility to regulatory uncertainties, these factors can impact the feasibility and cost of securing a mortgage with cryptocurrency.&nbsp;Here are some key challenges in crypto mortgaging:Higher costs: Compared to conventional mortgages, crypto-backed loans often have steeper interest rates. Since lenders consider these loans riskier, they set higher costs to protect themselves from potential losses.Price volatility: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, meaning their value can fluctuate significantly. If the value of the pledged crypto collateral drops, you may need to add more assets or partially repay the loan to prevent liquidation.Limited market adoption: Many sellers may not be willing to deal with a prospective buyer who has arranged their loan using cryptocurrencies. This might limit your property purchase options.Regulatory uncertainty: The legal framework for crypto-backed mortgages is still evolving. Shifting regulations could impact the availability, terms or tax treatment of these loans, creating uncertainty for borrowers.Did you know? With $12.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt spread across 84 million loans, the average American mortgage holder owes $144,593. These home loans represent a massive 70.2% of all consumer debt in the US, highlighting their crucial importance to the nation&rsquo;s financial health. How to decide on a crypto-backed mortgage? Before deciding on your cryptocurrency-backed mortgage, you need to make a thorough assessment of your financial status and risk tolerance.&nbsp;Begin by analyzing your cryptocurrency portfolio. Determine how much of your holdings you could pledge and consider how these assets may perform in the future.&nbsp;Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, collateralizing a single asset may be risky. Diversifying your collateral across various cryptocurrencies may help avoid potential losses if prices fluctuate.&nbsp;You also need to carefully analyze the loan terms. Understanding the interest rates, payback plan and any other expenses related to the mortgage is essential. Consider the risks, such as asset liquidation if their value falls dramatically or if you fail to meet repayment terms.As crypto-backed mortgages are a relatively new financial instrument, seeking professional guidance may help if you feel unsure about it. Consulting with financial and real estate experts specializing in crypto lending can assist you in navigating the process, structuring your loan and aligning your mortgage decision with your long-term investment and financial objectives.",

Crypto-backed mortgages are a kind of loan where borrowers use their cryptocurrency holdings, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH), as collateral to secure financing for real estate purchases. This approach allows you to access funds without selling your digital assets. By retaining crypto ownership, borrowers can still benefit from future price increases.There are various types of crypto-backed mortgages: purchase mortgages, cash-out refinancing and bridge loans.&nbsp;Purchase mortgages: These help you finance real estate using crypto as collateral.&nbsp;Cash-out refinancing: It allows you to refinance your existing mortgages by leveraging your crypto assets to access additional funds.&nbsp;Bridge loans: These loans provide short-term financing, helping you cover the period between purchasing a new property and selling an existing one.Crypto mortgages are particularly appealing if you want to preserve your holdings while securing real-world assets. However, you need to consider the volatility of cryptocurrencies and carefully assess the risks before opting for a crypto-backed mortgage.Lenders usually accept stablecoins such as Tether (USDt) and USDC (USDC) or major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Some lenders may accept a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies as collateral, which is known as cross-collateralization.Did you know? With traditional mortgages becoming increasingly difficult to obtain, particularly for younger individuals, alternative solutions are gaining traction. Fintech startups are addressing this demand by offering adjustable or fixed-rate mortgages secured by substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Crypto-based mortgages vs traditional mortgages Crypto-backed and traditional mortgages differ from eligibility requirements to risk factors. Traditional mortgages rely on credit history, income verification and down payments, while crypto-backed mortgages use digital assets as collateral.&nbsp;The approval process for crypto mortgages is often faster, but they come with higher interest rates and volatility risks. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties make crypto-backed loans less widely accepted in real estate markets. A comparison of the two mortgage types is given below: How do crypto-backed mortgages work? The basic mechanism of crypto-backed mortgages is that depositors calculate the value of the crypto the borrower proposes to collateralize and release a loan against the amount.&nbsp;To assess the value of the crypto assets, the lenders may apply a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which indicates the percentage of the collateral value you can borrow.&nbsp;For example, if the LTV ratio is 50%, you can secure a loan of $25,000 for collateralized crypto assets worth $50,000. Overcollateralization helps to create a buffer, which helps the lender if the value of the collateral goes down. Smart contracts are used to automate the execution of loan terms.&nbsp;Here is a step-by-step look at the functioning of crypto-backed mortgages:&nbsp;Step 1: Find a lender &ndash; Look for a financial institution or decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers crypto-backed mortgages. Compare different lenders based on their interest rates, fees and supported cryptocurrencies.Step 2: Apply and submit proof of ownership &ndash; Submit an application for getting a loan against the crypto you hold. You also need to provide proof of ownership of your digital assets. The lender will assess the worth of your crypto holdings to determine your borrowing limit. Some lenders may consider other financial factors, such as credit history.Step 3: Move crypto to escrow account &ndash; Once approved, you need to pledge the required amount of crypto by transferring it into an escrow account. This crypto acts as security for the mortgage loan.&nbsp;Step 4: Prep the loan &ndash; Complete the loan agreement, which outlines key terms like repayment schedules, interest rates and what happens if your collateral&rsquo;s value drops. Usually, if the value of the crypto drops, you will need to deposit more crypto in the escrow account so that the loan remains overcollateralized. If you fail to deposit additional crypto, the lender may liquidate your crypto deposits.Step 5: Disbursal of loan &ndash; The loan funds are typically disbursed in fiat currency for purchasing the property.Step 6: Make mortgage payments &ndash; Repay the loan according to the agreed terms. The interest rate may differ in line with the market value of the collateralized crypto.Step 7: Recover your collateral &ndash; If you complete all payments as per the loan agreement, you will get back your cryptocurrency from escrow. If you fail to repay it, the lender may liquidate your collateral to cover the outstanding amount.Did you know? Freddie Mac data shows that when fixed-rate mortgages were introduced in 1971, interest rates were about 7.5%. However, by 1980, they had dramatically increased to almost 20%. Benefits of crypto-backed mortgages Thanks to crypto-backed mortgages, you can access funds to invest in real estate without selling digital assets. You can leverage your crypto assets to take advantage of real estate market growth.&nbsp;Here are some key benefits of using a crypto-backed mortgage:Faster and simpler process: Compared to traditional mortgages, crypto-backed loans generally have a quicker and more streamlined approval process. Lenders use smart contracts to execute loan terms, making the whole process efficient and without prejudice.Liquidity without selling: You can access funds to invest in real estate without liquidating your crypto holdings. This is particularly beneficial during a real estate market upswing as you can retain your crypto assets while securing finances for real estate investment.Investment growth potential: Crypto-backed mortgages enable you to enjoy double growth. You benefit from appreciation in the prices of the real estate and the growth of your crypto assets.Broader accessibility: Crypto-backed mortgages provide financing opportunities for anyone who lacks traditional credit histories. If you have just settled in a country and don&rsquo;t have financial records there, crypto-backed loans become a viable option.&nbsp;Tax benefits: Since no assets are sold, you can avoid immediate capital gains tax. This allows you to access value without triggering taxable events. Challenges in crypto-backed mortgages While crypto-backed mortgages offer some unique advantages, they also come with several challenges you must consider. From price volatility to regulatory uncertainties, these factors can impact the feasibility and cost of securing a mortgage with cryptocurrency.&nbsp;Here are some key challenges in crypto mortgaging:Higher costs: Compared to conventional mortgages, crypto-backed loans often have steeper interest rates. Since lenders consider these loans riskier, they set higher costs to protect themselves from potential losses.Price volatility: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, meaning their value can fluctuate significantly. If the value of the pledged crypto collateral drops, you may need to add more assets or partially repay the loan to prevent liquidation.Limited market adoption: Many sellers may not be willing to deal with a prospective buyer who has arranged their loan using cryptocurrencies. This might limit your property purchase options.Regulatory uncertainty: The legal framework for crypto-backed mortgages is still evolving. Shifting regulations could impact the availability, terms or tax treatment of these loans, creating uncertainty for borrowers.Did you know? With $12.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt spread across 84 million loans, the average American mortgage holder owes $144,593. These home loans represent a massive 70.2% of all consumer debt in the US, highlighting their crucial importance to the nation&rsquo;s financial health. How to decide on a crypto-backed mortgage? Before deciding on your cryptocurrency-backed mortgage, you need to make a thorough assessment of your financial status and risk tolerance.&nbsp;Begin by analyzing your cryptocurrency portfolio. Determine how much of your holdings you could pledge and consider how these assets may perform in the future.&nbsp;Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, collateralizing a single asset may be risky. Diversifying your collateral across various cryptocurrencies may help avoid potential losses if prices fluctuate.&nbsp;You also need to carefully analyze the loan terms. Understanding the interest rates, payback plan and any other expenses related to the mortgage is essential. Consider the risks, such as asset liquidation if their value falls dramatically or if you fail to meet repayment terms.As crypto-backed mortgages are a relatively new financial instrument, seeking professional guidance may help if you feel unsure about it. Consulting with financial and real estate experts specializing in crypto lending can assist you in navigating the process, structuring your loan and aligning your mortgage decision with your long-term investment and financial objectives."

It is all still pretty unclear,&rdquo; the SilentSwap founder told Cointelegraph.Shibtoshi urged common sense regulations that encourage innovation and preserve the value propositions of decentralized finance, including self-custody, speed, and cost-effective transactions.The total value locked across the DeFi ecosystem has not yet returned to peak levels witnessed in 2021 and 2022.

    "description": "Institutional adoption of Bitcoin in the European Union remains sluggish, even as the United States moves forward with landmark cryptocurrency regulations that seek to establish BTC as a national reserve asset.More than three weeks after President Donald Trump&rsquo;s March 7 executive order outlined plans to use cryptocurrency seized in criminal cases to create a federal Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, European companies have largely remained silent on the issue.The stagnation may stem from Europe&rsquo;s complex regulatory regime, according to Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at Brickken, a European real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform.&ldquo;European corporate adoption remains limited,&rdquo; Fabrega told Cointelegraph, adding:&ldquo;This hesitation reflects a deeper structural divide, rooted in regulation, institutional signaling and market maturity. Europe has yet to take a definitive stance on Bitcoin as a reserve asset.&rdquo;Bitcoin&rsquo;s economic model favors early adopters, which may pressure more investment firms to consider gaining exposure to BTC. The asset has outperformed most major global assets since Trump&rsquo;s election despite a recent correction.Asset performance since Trump&rsquo;s election victory.

These include French banking giant BNP Paribas, Swiss firm 21Shares AG, VanEck Europe, Malta-based Jacobi Asset Management and Austrian fintech firm Bitpanda.A recent Bitpanda survey suggests that European financial institutions may be underestimating crypto investor demand by as much as 30%.Related: Friday&rsquo;s US inflation report may catalyze a Bitcoin April rallyEurope&rsquo;s &ldquo;fragmented&rdquo; regulatory landscape lacks clarityThe EU&rsquo;s slower adoption appears tied to its patchwork of regulations and more conservative investment mandates, analysts at Bitfinex told Cointelegraph. &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s institutional landscape is more fragmented, with regulatory hurdles and conservative investment mandates limiting Bitcoin allocations.&rdquo;&ldquo;Additionally, European pension funds and large asset managers have been slower to adopt Bitcoin exposure due to unclear guidelines and risk aversion,&rdquo; they added.Related: Bitcoin &lsquo;more likely&rsquo; to hit $110K before $76.5K &mdash; Arthur HayesBeyond the fragmented regulations, European retail investor appetite and retail participation are generally lower than in the US, according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo.Europe is &ldquo;generally more conservative in adopting new financial instruments,&rdquo; the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding:&ldquo;This stands in stark contrast to the deep, liquid, and relatively unified US capital market, where the spot Bitcoin ETF rollout was buoyed by strong retail demand and a clear regulatory green light.&rdquo;iShares Bitcoin ETP listings.

The NAYG alleged that Galaxy Digital violated the Martin Act over its alleged promotion of Terra, with Galaxy Digital agreeing to a $200 million settlement.According to NAYG documents filed on March 24, Galaxy Digital acquired 18.5 million LUNA tokens at a 30% discount in October 2020, then promoted them before selling them without abiding by disclosure rules.&nbsp;Scaramucci reiterated that Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz was under the impression everything he was saying about Luna was true, as he had been deceived by Terraform Labs and its former CEO, Do Kwon.Source: Amanda FischerMeanwhile, MoonPay president of enterprise, Keith Grossman, said he had never heard of the Martin Act and had to look it up using AI chatbot ChatGPT.&ldquo;It is so broad and essentially is the essence of lawfare,&rdquo; Grossman said. &ldquo;Sorry you got caught in the crosshairs of it, Mike,&rdquo; he added.Related: Sonic unveils high-yield algorithmic stablecoin, reigniting Terra-Luna &lsquo;PTSD&rsquo;The filing alleged that Galaxy helped a &ldquo;little-known&rdquo; token, referring to LUNA, increase its market price from $0.31 in October 2020 to $119.18 in April 2022 while &ldquo;profiting in the hundreds of millions of dollars.&rdquo;Asset manager and investor Anthony Pompliano said he isn&rsquo;t familiar with the details of the lawsuit but vouched for Novogratz, calling him a &ldquo;good man&rdquo; who has devoted a lot of time and money to helping others.The Terra collapse is one of the crypto industry&rsquo;s most infamous failures. In March 2024, SEC attorney Devon Staren said in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York that Terra was a &ldquo;house of cards&rdquo; that collapsed for investors in 2022.Magazine: Arbitrum co-founder skeptical of move to based and native rollups: Steven Goldfeder"

    "title": "Crypto Biz: GameStop takes the orange pill",
    "description": "It has been a wild few years for GameStop, the video game retailer turned memecoin stock. After being pulled from the edge of bankruptcy in 2021 thanks to a surging stock price, the company has made sensible business decisions over the years, such as shrinking its physical footprint and focusing on higher-margin items.&nbsp;Now, GameStop is trying to secure its survival by investing in Bitcoin (BTC). This approach seems to have worked for Strategy, Michael Saylor&rsquo;s business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin bank. Strategy has now amassed more than 500,000 BTC through successive purchases. And despite experiencing massive volatility, Strategy&rsquo;s stock has rallied more than 2,100% since acquiring its first Bitcoin back in 2020.GameStop has memed its way back to relevance &mdash; who says it can&rsquo;t secure at least the next decade of its existence by riding the Bitcoin wave?This week&rsquo;s Crypto Biz newsletter chronicles GameStop&rsquo;s Bitcoin gambit, the adoption magnet that is tokenization and the recovery in Bitcoin mining revenues.GameStop: Following the Strategy playbookOn March 25, GameStop confirmed that it had received board approval to invest in Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins.

    "title": "Twitter User Claims TradingView Has Ignored a Fibonacci Retracement Bug for 5 Years",
    "description": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken. Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&rdquo; However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug. As Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the &ldquo;CIX100&rdquo; index &mdash; an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens. At the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes. As of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment.",
