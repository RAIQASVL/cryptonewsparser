    "title": "What are crypto payment gateways, and how do they work?",
    "description": "Key takeawaysCrypto payment gateways enable businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments from customers.&nbsp;They act as intermediaries, converting crypto payments into the business's preferred currency (crypto or fiat).&nbsp;Crypto payment gateways reduce transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems and provide access to a global customer base.These gateways leverage blockchain technology to offer secure and faster transactions with fewer intermediaries, enhancing transparency and reducing the risk of fraud.The cryptocurrency industry faces significant challenges, particularly in the area of seamless conversion between digital assets and fiat currencies. This issue makes it difficult for businesses and users to adopt cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions.&nbsp;Crypto payment gateways address this need by simplifying the process of converting digital currencies into fiat, enabling smooth and efficient transactions.&nbsp;This article explores what crypto payment gateways are, how these gateways work, and their pros and cons.&nbsp;Cryptocurrency payment gateways, explainedA cryptocurrency payment gateway is a digital transaction facilitator that enables businesses to accept crypto payments while ensuring seamless processing and settlement.These gateways act as intermediaries between customers who pay with digital assets and merchants who receive crypto payments, helping businesses navigate the complexities of blockchain transactions. Examples of crypto payment gateways include BitPay, Coinbase Commerce and PayPal&rsquo;s crypto payment service.One of the key advantages of using a crypto payment gateway is that businesses can receive payments in cryptocurrency while opting to convert them into fiat currency, which is then deposited into their bank accounts. This eliminates concerns about crypto price volatility while allowing merchants to offer additional payment options to their customers.Are crypto payment gateways necessary for accepting digital currencies?While crypto payment gateways simplify the process of accepting digital assets, they are not the only way for businesses to receive cryptocurrency payments.Merchants can choose to accept crypto directly by using personal wallets, bypassing third-party processors. However, without a payment gateway, they would need to manually manage transactions, track payments on the blockchain, and handle currency conversion if they wish to receive fiat instead of crypto.For businesses looking to integrate cryptocurrency payments alongside traditional methods, crypto payment gateways provide an efficient solution. These services offer real-time transaction processing, automatic conversion to fiat and additional security features that protect businesses from fraudulent transactions.However, be aware of fees. Coinbase Commerce charges a 1% fee on all crypto payments. After your customer completes a payment, this fee is collected in the settlement currency of the transaction.For example, if your customer makes a $250 purchase in Bitcoin (BTC), and your settlement currency is in euros, it would collect 2.5 euros (1% of the payment amount) as a fee.Types of crypto payment gateways: Custodial vs. non-custodialCrypto payment gateways can be classified into two main types: custodial and non-custodial. The choice between these options depends on a business&rsquo;s preferences regarding security, control and ease of use.Custodial crypto payment gatewaysCustodial gateways function similarly to traditional payment processors. They receive and temporarily hold payments before allowing merchants to withdraw funds to their crypto wallets or convert them to fiat currency. This model is ideal for businesses that want a streamlined experience without dealing with direct wallet management.Key characteristics of custodial payment gateways include:Automated fiat conversion: Payments can be converted to local currency instantly, mitigating volatility risks.User-friendly dashboard: Merchants can manage transactions, track payment history, and withdraw funds through an online portal.Compliance features: Many custodial gateways implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures to meet regulatory requirements.Non-custodial crypto payment gatewaysNon-custodial payment gateways provide merchants with full control over their funds by immediately transferring payments to their wallets without holding them on behalf of the business. These solutions prioritize decentralization and security, allowing merchants to manage their own private keys.Key characteristics of non-custodial payment gateways include:Enhanced security: Funds are not stored by the gateway, which reduces the risk of hacks or third-party control.Direct crypto transfers: Payments are sent straight to the merchant&rsquo;s wallet, which eliminates withdrawal processes.Greater privacy: Merchants can accept payments without undergoing extensive KYC verification.Lower fees: Transaction costs are reduced for both parties since no intermediaries are involved.Increased transparency: The blockchain records transactions, providing an immutable and traceable record.Full control over funds: Merchants retain complete ownership and access to their crypto assets.Did you know? Major banks and fintechs, including Bank of America, Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe, are entering the stablecoin market to enhance cross-border payments.&nbsp;How do crypto payment gateways differ from traditional fiat payment gateways?Traditional payment gateways, such as those used for credit card processing, facilitate transactions in government-issued currencies like the US dollar or euro. These fiat gateways connect a merchant&rsquo;s payment system to a bank, verifying transactions based on the customer&rsquo;s bank details before authorizing or declining payments.Key distinctions between fiat and crypto payment gateways include:Currency type: Fiat gateways exclusively process national currencies, whereas cryptocurrency gateways support digital assets like BTC, Ether (ETH) and stablecoins.Decentralization: Traditional payment gateways rely on centralized financial institutions, while crypto payment gateways leverage blockchain technology for peer-to-peer transactions.Transaction speed: Crypto payments can be settled in minutes, whereas fiat transactions, especially international payments, may take days to clear.Chargeback protection: Unlike fiat payments, where chargebacks can be issued, crypto transactions are irreversible once recorded on the blockchain.While fiat payment gateways remain essential for conventional banking transactions, crypto payment gateways are expanding payment possibilities by integrating blockchain-based financial solutions.&nbsp;As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, businesses must evaluate their payment strategies and choose the right gateway solution that aligns with their operational needs.Pros and cons of cryptocurrency payment gatewaysYou must be aware of the pros and cons of cryptocurrency payment gateways before using them, whether for business transactions or everyday personal use.Pros of crypto payment gatewaysOne of the major advantages of using cryptocurrency payment gateways is the ability to settle transactions quickly. These platforms typically charge a minimal network fee (covered by the service provider) and a small service fee for customers. The streamlined process involves just one intermediary &mdash; the crypto payment processor &mdash; which enhances the user experience for both businesses and their clients.Additionally, crypto payment systems benefit from the transparency of blockchain technology, offering protection for merchants against chargeback fraud. Unlike traditional fiat payment systems, where transactions can sometimes result in businesses not receiving the funds after they have been deducted from a customer&rsquo;s account, crypto payments provide more certainty. Furthermore, these gateways can handle a variety of cryptocurrencies, mitigating the risk of market volatility for merchants.Cons of crypto payment gatewaysHowever, crypto payment gateways are still intermediaries in the process, meaning settlements are not fully decentralized. This centralization could pose a risk. For instance, if a crypto payment processor experiences operational disruptions, merchants may face delayed payments until the issue is resolved. Similarly, if the gateway is compromised by a cyberattack, businesses may lose access to their funds.Another downside is that crypto payment gateways can be more expensive than direct blockchain transactions. Since these gateways act as intermediaries, they add their own fees on top of the blockchain network&rsquo;s transaction costs.As centralized entities, crypto payment processors introduce a level of trust. Merchants need to ensure that the processor is capable of offering reliable, secure services to prevent potential cyber threats.Do cryptocurrency exchanges offer payment gateways?Binance, Coinbase and Kraken, which are centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, provide payment gateways to facilitate crypto transactions.&nbsp;Additionally, they offer application programming interfaces (APIs), which enable merchants to create custom checkout pages with full design control. APIs act as software intermediaries that allow different applications to communicate seamlessly.Binance offers a crypto payment solution called Binance Pay, tailored for businesses that are open to accepting digital currency. Merchants can integrate Binance Pay both online and in physical stores.&nbsp;By displaying a unique QR code, physical stores can offer a secure and contactless crypto payment option, enhancing customer convenience. For online businesses, Binance Pay allows seamless cross-border transactions, providing customers with more diverse payment options. Merchants can either create a merchant account or work with channel partners to start accepting crypto payments via Binance Pay.On the other hand, Coinbase offers its own payment gateway, Coinbase Commerce, which supports 10 different digital currencies, including ETH, USDC (USDC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Tether&rsquo;s USDt (USDT) and Litecoin (LTC).Payments processed through Coinbase Commerce are instantly converted to US dollars, ensuring stability for merchants. Importantly, Coinbase does not have access to any funds deposited into merchant accounts.&nbsp;If a merchant loses their 12-word recovery phrase, Coinbase is unable to assist in retrieving the lost assets. Additionally, Coinbase applies a 1% fee on transactions before the funds are transferred to the merchant&rsquo;s account, as mentioned above.Kraken Pay is a cryptocurrency payment processor that allows businesses to accept a wide range of digital currencies, offering fast and secure transactions. It provides easy integration with Kraken exchange wallets, low fees and the ability to convert crypto to fiat, but it still relies on centralized trust.Did you know? In March 2022, MoonPay enabled customers to purchase NFTs directly through marketplaces, simplifying the process by integrating traditional payment methods like credit cards and Apple Pay.Are crypto payment gateways secure?When selecting a cryptocurrency payment gateway, merchants should carefully evaluate how the provider manages the storage of cryptocurrencies and fiat funds.It&rsquo;s important to review factors such as transaction fees, the variety of supported cryptocurrencies and the platform&rsquo;s history regarding security breaches or scams. Understanding these elements helps merchants make informed decisions about which gateway aligns with their needs.In addition, ensuring that the crypto payment gateway offers reliable customer support is essential. Having access to prompt and effective assistance is crucial in case of disruptions or issues with payments. A responsive support team can help resolve problems quickly and minimize downtime for businesses.Finally, merchants should always check the reputation of a payment gateway before committing. Consulting specialized review sites and reading feedback from other users will provide insights into the platform&rsquo;s reliability and trustworthiness. Thorough research ensures that merchants select a secure and reliable payment processor for their business.",

Coinbase Commerce charges a 1% fee on all crypto payments. After your customer completes a payment, this fee is collected in the settlement currency of the transaction.For example, if your customer makes a $250 purchase in Bitcoin (BTC), and your settlement currency is in euros, it would collect 2.5 euros (1% of the payment amount) as a fee.Types of crypto payment gateways: Custodial vs. non-custodialCrypto payment gateways can be classified into two main types: custodial and non-custodial.

    "description": "Bitcoin is seeing unprecedented adoption with the US establishing a &ldquo;strategic Bitcoin reserve,&rdquo; but some prominent Bitcoin advocates believe the project is getting away from its roots.Earlier this year, Jack Dorsey, a Bitcoin proponent and founder of Twitter, said that he believed if Bitcoin becomes just a form of &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; then the project has failed. He said that a national Bitcoin reserve may be &ldquo;good for the nation-state, but I don&rsquo;t necessarily know if it&rsquo;s good for Bitcoin.&rdquo;&nbsp;Dorsey contended that Bitcoin needs to return to the white paper and work on becoming a form of peer-to-peer cash that can be transacted globally if it wants to become a success.&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the world, a number of &ldquo;circular Bitcoin economies&rdquo; have been working at just that &mdash; developing local economies that use Bitcoin as currency in an attempt to showcase its viability and what the future of BTC can look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bitcoin white paper put forward a cash system. Source: Bitcoin.orgBitcoin circular economies and Wall Street&nbsp;The Bitcoin Federation calls a Bitcoin circular economy a &ldquo;local economic ecosystem where Bitcoin (BTC) is used increasingly as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.&rdquo; That is, a place where Bitcoin fulfills the three roles of currency, as it is understood.&nbsp;There are diverse Bitcoin communities and circular economies all over the world, but their goal is similar in that they all believe that Bitcoin is the superior form of money and that it should be used &ldquo;as a means of payment for goods and services and for settlement of other financial obligations.&rdquo;Related: Failure or 5D chess? El Salvador IMF deal walks back Bitcoin adoptionThis approach of using Bitcoin as a currency diverges from the prevailing attitude in the United States, where crypto advocates view it as a reserve asset to be hoarded &mdash; akin to digital gold. President Donald Trump told the Nashville Bitcoin conference in July 2024, &ldquo;Never sell your Bitcoin.&rdquo;In a March 17 lecture at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Strategy CEO and Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor likened the digital currency to an investment asset. A significant stake, per Saylor, would allow the holder &mdash; such as the United States government &mdash; to exert control over the digital economy in another iteration of &ldquo;manifest destiny.&rdquo;&nbsp;When asked whether mass adoption by a nation like the US takes Bitcoin away from its founding principles, Isa Santos, founder of the Bitcoin Isla project in Isla Mujeres, Mexico, said: &ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s the beauty of Bitcoin. It&rsquo;s for your enemies too.&rdquo;&nbsp;Stelios Rammos, the founder of Bitcoin crowdfunding project Geyserfund, said that good or bad, adoption by governments was &ldquo;inevitable.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bitcoin is for everyone, and its truest founding principle is being permission-less money. The adoption of Bitcoin by governments was inevitable, and if there was a button we could press to say &lsquo;governments are banned from Bitcoin,&rsquo; then it wouldn&rsquo;t be Bitcoin anymore,&rdquo; he told Cointelegraph.Still, he believes that the Bitcoin community has a core set of values that promotes grassroots adoption of Bitcoin over government welfare, adding that Bitcoin is at a stage where Bitcoiners should be more concerned about how it&rsquo;s adopted rather than whether it&rsquo;s adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Circular economies will have a huge role to play in bringing about a future where Bitcoin is held and used by everyday people, and not just held as a pure asset within digital vaults at large banks and governments,&rdquo; said Rammos.&nbsp;Still, both said that there were tangible benefits to government Bitcoin adoption. Santos said that adoption from a large country like the US could still be a positive in that many look to the US as a leader in the financial world.&nbsp;Rammos said that the US adopting Bitcoin will raise awareness about the seminal cryptocurrency, which benefits the entire network and has knock-on effects for circular economies worldwide. What does Bitcoin do for these communities?Bitcoin circular economies are present all over the world. They have gained particular ground in developing economies where the local currency is unreliable as a store of value.&nbsp;In Cuba, where inflation is runaway and salaries are at unlivable lows, Bitcoin and Bitcoin circular economies have allowed locals to protect their savings.&nbsp;In rural Peru, where most people are unbanked i.e. do not have a bank account or access to financial services, Bitcoin has provided a way for locals to save their money and pay for school and everyday expenses.There are challenges, however. Namely, Bitcoin&rsquo;s notorious volatility makes it difficult to sell as an instrument for savings to rural communities, according to Valentin Popescu, co-founder of Motiv &mdash; a Bitcoin education and advocacy group in Peru.&nbsp;Bitcoin communities also face challenges of growing outside the group of Bitcoin expats and enthusiasts who are already present. Bitcoin advocates flocked to El Salvador, where Bitcoin Beach provided the first prototype for a Bitcoin circular economy. However, this did not translate into locals actually using Bitcoin.

Source: Geyser FundAside from the victories and challenges facing these communities, many of them also offer financial education programming and community-building initiatives.&nbsp;Santos said that &ldquo;each circular economy has its own unique features. They have to cater to the needs of the communities that make them.&rdquo; She said that one common factor among such communities is volunteering.&nbsp;Bitcoin Ekasi, a Bitcoin circular economy in South Africa, supports the local Surfer Kids community project by paying coaches&rsquo; salaries in Bitcoin while simultaneously onboarding local shops and vendors to accept Bitcoin payments.&nbsp;Rammos said that these communities can put lesser-known locations on the map, attracting tourism through &ldquo;Bitcoin expats&rdquo; who want to come to spend their Bitcoin and grow the local economy.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ultimately, the local populations gain from being a Bitcoin circular economy as much as the Bitcoin network benefits from having them, it&rsquo;s a true symbiosis,&rdquo; said Rammos.&nbsp;Whether it is Wall Street or Main Street that drives Bitcoin adoption, the end goal for the organizers running these communities is to have Bitcoin fully integrated into the financial world.Rammos concluded, &ldquo;There will be a point in the hopefully not-so-distant future, where we won&rsquo;t need the term circular economies anymore, it will just be the Bitcoin economy, or just, the economy.&rdquo;Magazine: Arbitrum co-founder skeptical of move to based and native rollups: Steven Goldfeder",

A significant stake, per Saylor, would allow the holder &mdash; such as the United States government &mdash; to exert control over the digital economy in another iteration of &ldquo;manifest destiny.&rdquo;&nbsp;When asked whether mass adoption by a nation like the US takes Bitcoin away from its founding principles, Isa Santos, founder of the Bitcoin Isla project in Isla Mujeres, Mexico, said: &ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s the beauty of Bitcoin. It&rsquo;s for your enemies too.&rdquo;&nbsp;Stelios Rammos, the founder of Bitcoin crowdfunding project Geyserfund, said that good or bad, adoption by governments was &ldquo;inevitable.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bitcoin is for everyone, and its truest founding principle is being permission-less money. The adoption of Bitcoin by governments was inevitable, and if there was a button we could press to say &lsquo;governments are banned from Bitcoin,&rsquo; then it wouldn&rsquo;t be Bitcoin anymore,&rdquo; he told Cointelegraph.Still, he believes that the Bitcoin community has a core set of values that promotes grassroots adoption of Bitcoin over government welfare, adding that Bitcoin is at a stage where Bitcoiners should be more concerned about how it&rsquo;s adopted rather than whether it&rsquo;s adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Circular economies will have a huge role to play in bringing about a future where Bitcoin is held and used by everyday people, and not just held as a pure asset within digital vaults at large banks and governments,&rdquo; said Rammos.&nbsp;Still, both said that there were tangible benefits to government Bitcoin adoption. Santos said that adoption from a large country like the US could still be a positive in that many look to the US as a leader in the financial world.&nbsp;Rammos said that the US adopting Bitcoin will raise awareness about the seminal cryptocurrency, which benefits the entire network and has knock-on effects for circular economies worldwide. What does Bitcoin do for these communities?Bitcoin circular economies are present all over the world. They have gained particular ground in developing economies where the local currency is unreliable as a store of value.&nbsp;In Cuba, where inflation is runaway and salaries are at unlivable lows, Bitcoin and Bitcoin circular economies have allowed locals to protect their savings.&nbsp;In rural Peru, where most people are unbanked i.e. do not have a bank account or access to financial services, Bitcoin has provided a way for locals to save their money and pay for school and everyday expenses.There are challenges, however. Namely, Bitcoin&rsquo;s notorious volatility makes it difficult to sell as an instrument for savings to rural communities, according to Valentin Popescu, co-founder of Motiv &mdash; a Bitcoin education and advocacy group in Peru.&nbsp;Bitcoin communities also face challenges of growing outside the group of Bitcoin expats and enthusiasts who are already present. Bitcoin advocates flocked to El Salvador, where Bitcoin Beach provided the first prototype for a Bitcoin circular economy. However, this did not translate into locals actually using Bitcoin.

He said that a national Bitcoin reserve may be &ldquo;good for the nation-state, but I don&rsquo;t necessarily know if it&rsquo;s good for Bitcoin.&rdquo;&nbsp;Dorsey contended that Bitcoin needs to return to the white paper and work on becoming a form of peer-to-peer cash that can be transacted globally if it wants to become a success.&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the world, a number of &ldquo;circular Bitcoin economies&rdquo; have been working at just that &mdash; developing local economies that use Bitcoin as currency in an attempt to showcase its viability and what the future of BTC can look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bitcoin white paper put forward a cash system.

He pointed out that regulatory differences across jurisdictions are an issue with MiCA providing clarity in the EU while the US market is still in debate, leading to a global &ldquo;patchwork of rules.&rdquo;He warned that such inconsistency risks pushing companies to less regulated markets. The consequence of such an exodus would be that consumer protection efforts would be undermined.Related: Tether seeks Big Four firm for its first full financial audit &mdash; ReportArdoino expects fast growthIn a subsequent X post, Ardoino claimed Tether currently counts 400 million users worldwide, adding that he expects that number to reach one billion soon.

A Tether spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the firm found the actions disappointing.Vidmanov explained that data concerning swaps between USDT and Circle&rsquo;s competing USDC (USDC) &ldquo;indicates a noticeable increase [&hellip;] following the delisting.&rdquo; He also raised concerns over the firm&rsquo;s reputation and &ldquo;ongoing investigations in the US related to sanctions compliance and Anti-Money Laundering.&rdquo;USDT/USDC swaps number. Source: DuneUS authorities are reportedly investigating third-party use of Tether&rsquo;s stablecoins for criminal activities.Ardoino already commented on those claims when they surfaced in late October 2024, calling the story &ldquo;old noise.&rdquo; Still, according to Vidmanov, with all those challenges, &ldquo;achieving the projected figures within the next one to two years seems unlikely unless there are significant shifts in global policy and a substantial influx of new users from underpenetrated crypto markets.&rdquo;Tether and Paolo Ardoino had not responded to Cointelegraph&rsquo;s inquiry by publication time.Magazine: Stablecoin for cyber-scammers launches, Sony L2 drama: Asia Express",

Anime ID simplifies this experience by offering fans one simple identity to use across all aspects of their fandom.&rdquo;Taing said the first initiative would be the Anime Art Festival on Soneium, which is designed to spotlight anime-focused intellectual properties, creators and Web3 projects.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are excited to kick things off with the globally acclaimed Solo Leveling in collaboration with the Otherworld team,&rdquo; Taing told Cointelegraph.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Moca Network project lead Kenneth Shek told Cointelegraph that anime is a &ldquo;core part&rdquo; of modern-day entertainment culture, and the partnership is just the beginning.&nbsp;&ldquo;Starting with anime, we foresee many other entertainment-related applications to participate in the network, and further enrich the user-owned identity and data,&rdquo; Shek added.&nbsp;Sony Block Solutions Labs (Sony BSL) launched the blockchain&rsquo;s public testnet on Aug. 28, 2024. The layer-2 network aims to foster a fan community centered on creators who connect diverse values through the blockchain.&nbsp;On Jan. 14, the blockchain&rsquo;s mainnet went live amid backlash from community members. Pump.fun&rsquo;s Alon slammed the network for blacklisting specific memecoins and &ldquo;nuking everyone&rsquo;s position to 0.&rdquo;Related: Captain Tsubasa NFT soccer game debuts on Oasys blockchainGhibli-inspired memecoins flood the crypto marketOn March 25, OpenAI launched image generation for its ChatGPT-4o mode. This was met with social media users generating images in the art style of Studio Ghibli, a company known for its anime films. Following the surge, a Ghibli-inspired memecoin reached a market capitalization of $20 million. Since then, at least 20 other Ghibli-related memecoins have been created in the market.&nbsp;While the news may be great for Web3 and anime fans, anime and crypto may not always work in favor of men seeking relationships. On Aug. 26, women ranked anime as the third-most unattractive hobby for a man, while crypto took the number two spot.&nbsp;Magazine: Azuki founder airdrops ANIME for a &lsquo;billion global fans&rsquo;: Zagabond, NFT Creator"

    "description": "A South Korean court temporarily lifted the partial business suspension on crypto exchange Upbit that had prohibited the trading platform from servicing new clients for three months.&nbsp;On Feb. 25, South Korea&rsquo;s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) sanctioned the exchange, imposing a three-month ban on deposits and withdrawals for new clients. The FIU previously said the suspension was in response to Upbit&rsquo;s violations of policies that prohibit exchanges from transacting with unregistered virtual asset service providers (VASPs).&nbsp;In response to the FIU&rsquo;s sanction, Upbit&rsquo;s parent company, Dunamu, filed a lawsuit against the FIU, seeking to overturn the partial suspension order. In addition, Dunamu requested an injunction to temporarily lift the suspension order.&nbsp;On March 27, local media Newsis reported that the court granted the injunction, moving the suspension order 30 days after a court judgment is reached. This allows Upbit to service new clients while the legal battle continues.&nbsp;Upbit investigations led to a 3-month suspension orderFounded in 2017, Upbit is South Korea&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange. On Oct. 10, the country&rsquo;s Financial Services Commission (FSC) initiated an investigation into Upbit for potential breaches of the country&rsquo;s anti-monopoly laws.&nbsp;In addition to anti-monopoly breaches, the exchange is suspected of violating Know Your Customer (KYC) rules. On Nov. 15, the FIU identified up at least 500,000 to 600,000 potential KYC violations of the exchange. The regulator spotted alleged breaches while reviewing the exchange&rsquo;s business license renewal.&nbsp;In 2018, South Korean regulators ended anonymous crypto trading for its citizens. With the new development, users must pass KYC procedures before being allowed to trade digital assets on crypto trading platforms like Upbit.&nbsp;Apart from these allegations, the FIU accused Upbit of facilitating 45,000 transactions with unregistered foreign crypto exchanges. This violates the country&rsquo;s Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information.Related: South Korea plans to regulate cross-border stablecoin transactionsSouth Korea cracks down on overseas exchangesOn Oct. 25, 2024, South Korea strengthened its oversight of cross-border crypto asset transactions. The country&rsquo;s finance minister, Choi Sang-Mok, said the government will introduce a reporting mandate for businesses that handle cross-border transactions with digital assets. This aims to promote preemptive monitoring of crypto transactions &ldquo;used for tax evasion and currency manipulation.&rdquo;In line with the rules, South Korea&rsquo;s Google Play blocked the applications of 17 crypto exchanges at the request of the FIU.

The FIU previously said the suspension was in response to Upbit&rsquo;s violations of policies that prohibit exchanges from transacting with unregistered virtual asset service providers (VASPs).&nbsp;In response to the FIU&rsquo;s sanction, Upbit&rsquo;s parent company, Dunamu, filed a lawsuit against the FIU, seeking to overturn the partial suspension order. In addition, Dunamu requested an injunction to temporarily lift the suspension order.&nbsp;On March 27, local media Newsis reported that the court granted the injunction, moving the suspension order 30 days after a court judgment is reached. This allows Upbit to service new clients while the legal battle continues.&nbsp;Upbit investigations led to a 3-month suspension orderFounded in 2017, Upbit is South Korea&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange. On Oct. 10, the country&rsquo;s Financial Services Commission (FSC) initiated an investigation into Upbit for potential breaches of the country&rsquo;s anti-monopoly laws.&nbsp;In addition to anti-monopoly breaches, the exchange is suspected of violating Know Your Customer (KYC) rules. On Nov. 15, the FIU identified up at least 500,000 to 600,000 potential KYC violations of the exchange. The regulator spotted alleged breaches while reviewing the exchange&rsquo;s business license renewal.&nbsp;In 2018, South Korean regulators ended anonymous crypto trading for its citizens. With the new development, users must pass KYC procedures before being allowed to trade digital assets on crypto trading platforms like Upbit.&nbsp;Apart from these allegations, the FIU accused Upbit of facilitating 45,000 transactions with unregistered foreign crypto exchanges.

This model doesn&rsquo;t build lasting value &mdash; it creates temporary illusions of success.DeFi deserves a better approach to value creation and capital efficiency. The current emission-driven yield model has three fatal flaws that continue to undermine the industry&rsquo;s potential.Inflationary emissionsMost yield in DeFi comes from inflationary token emissions rather than sustainable revenue.

The solution requires shifting from extractive to regenerative economic models, and protocol-owned liquidity represents one of the most promising approaches to solving this problem.

    "title": "Twitter User Claims TradingView Has Ignored a Fibonacci Retracement Bug for 5 Years",
    "description": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken. Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&rdquo; However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug. As Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the &ldquo;CIX100&rdquo; index &mdash; an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens. At the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes. As of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment.",
