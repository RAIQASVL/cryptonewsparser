    "full_content": "# Trump exonerates BitMEX co-founder in landmark anti-money laundering case\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued full pardons to the three co-founders of crypto exchange BitMEX on March 27, clearing their names years after they admitted to violating US anti-money laundering laws, CNBC reported.\n\nArthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, who launched BitMEX in 2014, had each pleaded guilty to charges under the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nProsecutors alleged they allowed US customers to trade on the platform without proper identity checks, turning the exchange into what authorities called a hub for illicit financial activity.\n\nIn 2022, the three co-founders received probation sentences and collectively paid tens of millions in fines to resolve both criminal and civil enforcement actions.\n\nHayes, the former CEO, served six months under home confinement. Delo, the firm’s former strategy chief, was sentenced to 30 months of probation, while Reed, who served as CTO, received an 18-month term of probation.\n\nTrump’s pardons arrived just over three months after BitMEX itself agreed to pay $100 million to settle allegations that it failed to maintain required compliance programs for detecting and preventing money laundering.\n\nFederal prosecutors had accused the company’s leadership of ignoring legal obligations while continuing to court business from American traders. According to court filings, BitMEX allowed users to register with only an email address and failed to enforce its stated ban on U.S. customers.\n\nIn a statement after the pardon was announced, Delo said the charges stemmed from what he called an outdated law and a politicized enforcement effort. He described the pardons as a “vindication” and claimed the trio should never have been prosecuted.\n\nDelo:\n\n“We were wrongfully made to serve as an example.”\n\nHayes, Delo and Reed had each paid $10 million in criminal fines as part of their plea deals, in addition to a $30 million civil penalty imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nThe White House has not issued a formal comment on the pardons.\n\nFounded in 2014, BitMEX became one of the earliest and most influential derivatives exchanges in the crypto industry, offering users high-leverage trading products with minimal registration requirements.\n\nAt its peak, the exchange processed billions in daily volume, attracting users worldwide, including those in the United States.\n\nFederal authorities began investigating BitMEX as part of a broader crackdown on offshore platforms catering to American traders without proper compliance programs.\n\nIn 2020, the US Department of Justice and the CFTC filed parallel actions against the exchange and its founders. Prosecutors accused the executives of knowingly evading US regulations and failing to establish even rudimentary systems to detect or prevent money laundering.\n\nThe case marked one of the first times the federal government pursued criminal penalties against crypto exchange operators, setting a precedent for future enforcement actions in the digital asset space.\n\nAJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

    "full_content": "# Protocols must prove demand as stablecoin liquidity per token falls 99%\n\nThe average stablecoin liquidity per token declined from $1.8 million in 2021 to just $5,500 in March 2025, a 99.7% drop, forcing protocols to demonstrate sound reasons for investors to hold.\n\nAccording to a recent report by research firm Decentralised, the drop illustrates how rising token issuance, now surpassing 40 million assets, has diluted available capital without a corresponding increase in demand or user retention.\n\nThe report frames this trend as evidence of a zero-sum dynamic in crypto capital allocation, where the influx of new tokens outpaces the expansion of capital pools, resulting in lower liquidity, weaker communities, and diminished engagement.\n\nWithout durable revenue sources, user interest frequently dissipates following short-term incentives such as airdrops. Without sustainable economic structures, attention has become a liability rather than an asset.\n\nThe report used stablecoin liquidity as a proxy for capital availability. It highlighted that the stagnation of new capital inflows amid surging token counts has left many crypto projects undercapitalized.\n\nWith fewer resources per token, the traditional 2021-era playbook — launching a community through Discord servers and airdrop campaigns — no longer produces lasting engagement.\n\nInstead, the report argues, projects must now demonstrate product-market fit and sustained demand through revenue generation.\n\nRevenue functions as a financial metric and as a mechanism for signaling relevance and economic utility. Protocols that generate and retain cash flows are better positioned to justify token valuations, establish governance legitimacy, and maintain user participation.\n\nThe report distinguished between mature platforms like Ethereum (ETH), which rely on ecosystem depth and native incentives, and newer protocols that must earn their place through consistent performance and transparent operations.\n\nThe report outlined four maturity stages for crypto projects: Explorers, Climbers, Titans, and Seasonals. Each category represents a different relationship to capital formation, risk tolerance, and value distribution.\n\nExplorers are early-stage protocols operating with centralized governance and volatile, incentive-driven revenue. While some, such as Synthetix and Balancer, show short-term spikes in usage, their primary goal remains survival rather than profitability.\n\nClimbers, with annual revenue between $10 million and $50 million, begin transitioning from emissions-based growth to user retention and ecosystem governance. These projects must navigate strategic decisions around growth versus distribution while preserving momentum.\n\nTitans — such as Aave, Uniswap, and Hyperliquid — generate consistent revenue, have decentralized governance structures, and operate with strong network effects. Their focus is category dominance, not diversification. Due to the Titans’ established treasuries and operational discipline, they can afford to conduct token buybacks or other value-return programs.\n\nSeasonals, by contrast, are short-lived phenomena driven by hype cycles and social momentum. Projects like FriendTech and PumpFun experience brief periods of high activity but struggle to maintain user interest or revenue consistency over the long-term.\n\nWhile some may evolve, most remain speculative plays without enduring infrastructure relevance.\n\nDrawing parallels with public equity markets, the report noted that younger firms typically reinvest earnings while mature firms return capital via dividends or buybacks.\n\nIn crypto, this distinction is similarly tied to protocol maturity. Titans are well-positioned to implement buybacks or structured distributions, while Explorers and Climbers are advised to focus on reinvestment until operational fundamentals are secured.\n\nAccording to the report, buybacks are a flexible distribution tool that is particularly suited for projects with volatile revenue or seasonal demand patterns.\n\nHowever, the report cautioned that poorly executed buybacks can benefit short-term traders over long-term holders. Effective buyback programs require strong treasury reserves, valuation discipline, and transparent execution. Without these, distribution can erode trust and misallocate capital.\n\nThe trend mirrors broader shifts in traditional markets. In 2024, buybacks accounted for roughly 60% of corporate profit distribution, outpacing dividends.\n\nThis approach allows firms to modulate capital return according to market conditions, but governance risks remain if the incentives driving buyback decisions are misaligned.\n\nThe report identified investor relations (IR) as a critical but underdeveloped function across crypto projects. Despite public claims of transparency, most teams release financial data selectively.\n\nTo build durable trust with token holders and institutional participants, a more institutional approach, including quarterly reporting, real-time dashboards, and clear token distribution disclosures, is needed.\n\nLeading projects are beginning to implement these standards. Aave’s “Buy and Distribute” program, backed by a $95 million treasury, allocates $1 million weekly for structured buybacks.\n\nHyperliquid dedicates 54% of revenue to buybacks and 46% to LP incentives, using revenue alone without external venture funding. Jupiter introduced the Litterbox Trust as a non-custodial mechanism to manage $9.7 million in JUP for future distributions only after reaching financial sustainability.\n\nThese examples show that responsible capital allocation depends on timing, governance, and communication, not just market conditions. As token liquidity per asset continues to decline, the pressure on projects to prove viability through cash flow and transparency will likely intensify.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.”\n\nThe FDIC said it will continue working with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets to issue additional guidance and coordinate with other regulatory agencies to replace prior interagency documents on digital assets.\n\nThe Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets Markets, Bo Hines, called the decision “a huge step forward toward innovation and adoption.”\n\nThe agency’s decision reflects a broader effort to reset its approach to financial innovation.\n\nIn recent years, several banks pursuing digital asset activities reportedly received informal “pause” letters instructing them to halt engagement with crypto services, including custody, tokenized deposits, and even basic retail crypto offerings.\n\nCrypto industry figures said these decisions were a part of “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged effort by former President Joe Biden’s administration to hinder the crypto industry’s growth in the US.\n\nHill has criticized the actions for lacking transparency and contributing to a perception that the FDIC discouraged innovation through non-public enforcement tactics.\n\nIn a January speech, he acknowledged that the agency had failed to offer banks clear public guidance, opting instead for ad hoc interventions.\n\nHe cited the over 20 cases where banks had received letters asking them to stop or delay crypto-related activities without formal rulemaking or open comment periods.\n\nCall to reevaluate\n\nHill emphasized that compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act should not be used as a pretext for denying access to banking services and called for a reevaluation of how the BSA is implemented across financial institutions.\n\nRecent internal discussions at the FDIC haven reortedly focused on allowing banks to pursue tokenized deposit services and other blockchain-based financial infrastructure without unnecessary regulatory delays.\n\nThe move brings the FDIC into closer alignment with other regulators, such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has begun formalizing crypto regulatory frameworks.\n\nIt also comes amid growing pressure from industry participants and lawmakers for banking regulators to provide a consistent, transparent roadmap for lawful crypto-related services.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

It will further enable the development of innovative digital products, services, and new business models, while reducing cost and increasing access to international markets.”\n\nThis move represents a significant step forward in the UAE’s broader digital transformation strategy.\n\nThe UAE has also introduced updated symbols for its national currency to align with its growing focus on digital finance.\n\nThe new symbol for the physical Dirham features a bold capital “D” crossed by two horizontal lines. These lines represent the country’s vision for economic stability and growth. The design takes cues from the national flag, reinforcing the UAE’s confidence in its financial future. For the digital version, a circular frame in the UAE flag’s colors surrounds the “D” symbol.\n\nThe design is intended to reflect the country’s ambition to lead in blockchain innovation and digital financial services.\n\nBalama described the updated branding as a signal of progress and a key part of the country’s digital agenda. He emphasized that the Digital Dirham will improve financial resilience, inclusion, and regulatory oversight while enabling the development of new products and services.\n\nMeanwhile, this announcement follows the CBUAE’s recent membership in the Global Foreign Exchange Committee. It is the first central bank in the Arab world to join the group, which promotes transparency and integrity in global FX markets.\n\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Nasdaq stated that the ETF aims to deliver this access with lower costs and fewer technical barriers compared to self-custody or using crypto exchanges.\n\nThe filing noted that CSC Delaware Trust Company will serve as the fund’s trustee, and Coinbase Custody Trust Company will handle custodial services.\n\nMeanwhile, BNY Mellon is expected to take on administration and transfer agent duties, while Foreside Fund Services will manage marketing.

    "full_content": "# South Carolina explores Bitcoin reserve, drops Coinbase lawsuit\n\nSouth Carolina has taken a significant step toward integrating digital assets into state-level financial strategy.\n\nOn March 27, the state lawmakers introduced a new bill to create a Bitcoin reserve to safeguard public funds from inflation.\n\nAt the same time, the state dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase over alleged securities violations tied to its staking services.\n\nRepresentative Jordan Pace introduced a new bill allowing South Carolina to invest some public funds in Bitcoin.\n\nThe proposed legislation, the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act (H4256), positions Bitcoin as a safeguard against inflation and economic instability.\n\nThe bill would authorize the State Treasurer to allocate up to 10% of state-held funds to Bitcoin if passed. However, there’s a hard limit—South Carolina cannot hold more than 1 million BTC.\n\nMeanwhile, the funds for these investments would come from existing sources such as the General Fund and the Budget Stabilization Reserve Fund.\n\nThe bill goes a step further by setting transparency standards. It requires the public disclosure of wallet addresses linked to the Bitcoin reserve. This would allow citizens to monitor transactions and verify holdings on the blockchain.\n\nIn a unique twist, the bill also allows residents to make voluntary Bitcoin contributions. The proposal outlines strict storage requirements to protect the assets, including the use of cold wallets or certified custodians.\n\nAlongside the legislative push, South Carolina has decided to withdraw its legal challenge against Coinbase.\n\nThe case, filed in June 2023, accused the crypto exchange of violating securities laws through its staking services.\n\nHowever, the dismissal followed an agreement between the state’s securities division and Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, welcomed the news, noting that South Carolina residents had missed nearly $2 million in staking rewards during the legal dispute.\n\nNonetheless, Grewal praised the state’s decision and expressed optimism that other states—such as California, New Jersey, and Illinois—would follow suit.\n\nMeanwhile, this decision mirrors a similar move by Vermont, which dropped its lawsuit earlier in March.\n\nThe withdrawal comes shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended its case against Coinbase in February.\n\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

    "full_content": "# Terraform Labs launches claims portal for algorithmic UST stablecoin crash victims\n\nTerraform Labs, the bankrupt firm behind the failed TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin, has launched a crypto claims portal.\n\nThis platform is designed to compensate users affected by the project’s dramatic crash in 2022. Creditors can submit claims between March 31 and April 30, 2025. Claims submitted after the deadline will not be considered.\n\nTo file a claim, users must prove asset ownership by providing information that includes wallet addresses, read-only API keys, and other supporting documents.\n\nA Wind Down Trust will assess the claims created during Terraform Labs’ ongoing bankruptcy process.\n\nMeanwhile, not all assets will qualify for compensation. Crypto holdings with on-chain liquidity under $100 and specific tokens like Luna 2.0 on the Terra 2.0 blockchain are excluded.\n\nUST creditors can expect an initial determination of their claim amount within 90 days after the submission deadline. They will have the option to accept or dispute the result.\n\nHowever, if a claim is not contested, disbursements will begin as soon as practicable, and all payouts will be distributed pro rata.\n\nConsidering this, Terraform Labs urged creditors to review the official Crypto Loss Claim Procedures on the claims portal to ensure their submissions meet the required standards.\n\nTerraform filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2024, years after the fallout from the UST crash. In September 2024, a US court approved the filing following a $4.47 billion settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn a separate development, investment firm Galaxy Digital reached a $200 million settlement with the New York Attorney General.\n\nAccording to the regulator, the asset management firm and its founder, Michael Novogratz, promoted the LUNA token while quietly offloading large amounts without telling investors. It pointed out that Galaxy acquired LUNA in 2020 and later marketed it to clients despite its selling plans.\n\nThe regulator stated:\n\n“Galaxy’s conduct, including its misrepresentations and omissions about Luna while simultaneously selling Luna and failing to disclose its then-present intent to sell, constituted violations of the Martin Act and violations of New York Executive Law Section 63(12).”\n\nAccording to the settlement, Galaxy didn’t admit wrongdoing but agreed to pay the fine in installments over three years, starting with $40 million due within two weeks.\n\nThe company will also update internal policies to improve transparency and avoid conflicts of interest in future token promotions.\n\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.
