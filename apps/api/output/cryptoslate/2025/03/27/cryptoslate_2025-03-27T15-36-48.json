    "full_content": "# NYSE parent company exploring Circle’s USDC and USYC stablecoins for financial systems\n\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is exploring the integration of Circle’s stablecoin products—USD Coin (USDC) and US Yield Coin (USYC)—across its financial infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a March 27 announcement, the initiative will examine how these stablecoins could be integrated across ICE’s exchanges, clearing operations, and market data platforms.\n\nUSDC, Circle’s flagship stablecoin, recently crossed the $60 billion mark in market capitalization, making it the second-largest stablecoin globally after Tether’s USDT.\n\nThe asset is backed by reserves managed through the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSince its launch in 2018, USDC has grown to support hundreds of millions of wallets and serves a broad range of use cases—from facilitating crypto trading to enabling seamless global payments and preserving dollar value in digital form.\n\nICE is also exploring Circle’s USYC, a newer tokenized asset offering a 3.8% yield. USYC is backed by short-duration US Treasury securities and repo-related instruments. It originated from Hashnote, a crypto platform Circle acquired earlier this year.\n\nLynn Martin, president of the NYSE, expressed optimism about the growing role of regulated digital currencies in traditional finance. She noted that assets like USDC and USYC could provide efficient, trustworthy alternatives to conventional fiat in institutional markets.\n\nICE’s move illustrates the growing interest from legacy financial institutions in stablecoins, especially as the regulatory landscape begins to take form.\n\nOn March 26, US lawmakers introduced a landmark stablecoin bill to formalize digital dollar issuance standards.\n\nThe proposed legislation requires stablecoin issuers to be approved as banks, licensed nonbanks, or state-regulated entities.\n\nWith monthly reporting and audits, these tokens must be backed one-to-one with cash or low-risk government assets. The regulation also bans algorithmic stablecoins for two years and restricts using foreign-issued tokens unless they meet US regulatory standards.\n\nThis regulatory clarity level appears to be attracting traditional financial institutions who have begun exploring the sector.\n\nTether CEO Paolo Ardoino stressed this in a recent X post, saying:\n\n“A new era begins: the stablecoin multiverse. Hundreds of companies and governments are launching (or will soon) their stablecoins.”\n\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.\n\nAlso known as \"Akiba,\" Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast.

    "full_content": "# South Korean exchange UPbit saw massive earnings growth in 2024 amid regulatory hiccups\n\nDunamu, the parent company of South Korea’s largest crypto exchange UPbit, reported a significant increase in earnings for 2024, defying ongoing regulatory challenges.\n\nChosun Bix, citing the firm’s annual business filing, reported that Dunamu’s operating profit surged 85.1% to 1.19 trillion won (approximately $682 million) in 2024.\n\nAccording to the report, the firm’s revenue climbed 70.5% year-over-year to 1.73 trillion won ($1.1 billion), while net profit rose 22.2%, hitting 983.8 billion won ($670 million) from 805 billion won in 2023.\n\nThe report attributed this strong performance to heightened trading activity fueled by Bitcoin halving. Last April, BTC had its fourth halving event, which slashed block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nBeyond that, the firm noted that positive investor sentiment grew following the US election of Donald Trump, who is widely seen as favorable to crypto markets.\n\nSince his inauguration, the Trump administration has implemented a series of pro-crypto moves that have positively improved the trajectory of the emerging industry and attracted significant institutional investors.\n\nAt the same time, Dunamu pointed out that the expectations of lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve helped improve global liquidity, further boosting digital asset activity.\n\nDespite the positive financial results, Dunamu remains entangled in regulatory scrutiny.\n\nSouth Korean regulators accused Upbit of failing to conduct sufficient due diligence on many of its users. In response, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) barred the exchange from accepting new customers or allowing them to transfer virtual assets starting March 7.\n\nHowever, Dunamu contested the FIU’s decision, arguing that it had already taken necessary compliance measures.\n\nThe firm maintained that the sanctions were disproportionate and imposed without understanding the context. According to Dunamu, the penalty could cause lasting harm to its operations.\n\nAccording to a report from local outlet Newsis, a South Korean court temporarily lifted the ban on March 27.\n\nThe ruling allows Dunamu to challenge the regulatory suspension in court and pauses the ban’s enforcement until a final verdict is reached.\n\nEven then, the suspension would not take effect for 30 days after the ruling—offering the company critical time to continue operating uninterrupted.\n\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

    "full_content": "# Public trust in Argentine president Javier Milei craters after LIBRA memecoin scandal\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei is facing a sharp drop in public trust following his controversial connection to the LIBRA memecoin collapse.\n\nA national poll measuring trust in Milei following the LIBRA scandal showed that 57.6% of Argentinians no longer trust the president, while 36% remain supportive and 6.4% are undecided.\n\nThis suggests that nearly six in ten Argentinians have lost confidence in their leader — a sign of growing disillusionment with the administration’s handling of the country’s economy and security.\n\nThe poll was conducted by Zuban Córdoba between March 12 and March 14 and polled 1,600 Argentinians.\n\nMilei’s credibility began to unravel after he publicly backed LIBRA, a memecoin that saw its market cap explode to over $4 billion in hours.\n\nHowever, the price soon plummeted by over 99%, wiping out investor funds almost overnight.\n\nAlthough Milei has since attempted to distance himself from the debacle, claiming he acted with good intentions, blockchain investigations suggest otherwise.\n\nOn-chain analysts found that several insiders with significant holdings in LIBRA sold off more than $100 million shortly after his post, fueling accusations of a coordinated pump-and-dump scheme.\n\nThe controversy has since morphed into a national issue. Law enforcement agencies are now gathering evidence, including digital transaction data and promotional content associated with the failed coin.\n\nThe authorities are also working to freeze assets tied to the project’s developers. Meanwhile, Interpol has been asked to issue a Red Notice for Hayden Davis, a crypto entrepreneur allegedly tied to LIBRA’s creation and collapse.\n\nThe damage to Milei’s administration goes beyond one token, as public dissatisfaction has been climbing steadily since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe March poll highlights a shift in sentiment, describing a clear trend of growing negativity around Milei’s leadership. Currently, 58% of citizens disapprove of his presidency, and this number continues to rise.\n\nAt the core of this discontent is Argentina’s battered economy. Nearly two-thirds of respondents hold a negative view of the IMF and oppose any new loans. Despite the government’s attempts to frame international agreements as progress, the public isn’t convinced.\n\nInsecurity adds another layer of frustration. Half of Argentinians believe the government has done little to improve public safety. In large urban areas, over 50% report feeling unsafe, and many say the situation has worsened under Milei’s watch.\n\nWhile Milei’s approval rating still hovers at 41.6%, analysts warn that governability could become a serious concern if support drops below 40%.\n\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

    "content_type": "Article",
    "full_content": "# The UX overhaul blockchain needs to reach a billion users\n\nThe following is a guest post from Susannah Evans, IBC Product Lead at Interchain Foundation.\n\nThe future of the internet is shaping up to be promising, and there is no doubt that blockchain and Web3 technologies have been at the forefront of this innovation, promising decentralization, security, and financial sovereignty. However, despite all its advancements, mass adoption of the technology still remains elusive. The primary culprit? A poor user experience. Even though interoperability protocols have improved significantly, the process of moving assets and interacting across multiple chains still remains too complex for institutional and everyday users.\n\nThe recent Cross-Chain Interoperability Report 2024 highlights that the biggest challenge to adoption is the high friction users face when they navigate blockchain ecosystems. As of today, users need to manage multiple wallets, manually sign numerous transactions, and navigate complexities when identifying the optimal route for transferring assets between chains. These inefficiencies have forced users into ecosystem silos rather than encouraging them to explore more cross-chain interactions.\n\nWhen comparing the Web2 experience to that of Web3, the difference is night and day. Take traditional financial transactions as an example. There is still a lot of complexity in Web2, but Web2 is just better at hiding it, meaning users can navigate this space without thinking about the backend. For instance, when sending money through a payment app, users need not bother about bank settlement layers, messaging protocols, or verifying different clearing mechanisms. Web3, by comparison, places too much of this burden on users, making it essential for them to understand the backend and thereby forcing them to deal with intricate transaction approvals, security risks involved, and token management systems. This has been fine to date for an audience of crypto enthusiasts keen to understand the tech on which they operate. However, as the Web3 ecosystem looks to scale to a global user base, the industry must rethink this user experience to captivate the attention of the layperson that has no prior dealings with blockchain.\n\nThere is no denying that interoperability is solving some of the technical limitations of blockchain technology. However, for users, the experience still leaves much to be desired. Recent data indicated that over 85 million people worldwide use blockchain wallets. However, despite the growing adoption, the challenge of wallet fragmentation remains a glaring issue. Unlike in Web2, where a single login provides access to multiple services, blockchain requires users to maintain different wallets for different ecosystems. This makes cross-chain interactions painstaking, as the experience of switching between multiple wallets is neither intuitive nor seamless.\n\nManaging wallets across chains continues to remain a major point of friction for users. While transaction batching has reduced the burden of multi-signing, users still often need to switch wallets when interacting across different blockchains. This process is not only painstaking but also increases the likelihood of human errors—such as approving the wrong contract accidentally or sending assets to an incorrect address—leading to a potential loss of funds. Seamless interoperability should mean users can move assets and interact across chains without needing to constantly switch wallets or navigate complex approval processes that are still manual.\n\nSecurity concerns complicate the case for Web3 adoption further. With an aggregate of $2.7 billion lost in cross-chain bridge exploits from July 2021 till Aug 2024 alone, it should come as no surprise that many users hesitate to move assets across blockchains due to fear of hacks or transaction failures. When a single mistake can result in permanent asset loss, it comes as no surprise that even experienced users remain cautious when engaging in cross-chain transactions. While significant strides have been made in addressing these challenges, it is essential that interoperability solutions factor in differences among chains to build trust and ensure security, reliability, and a seamless experience for everyday users.\n\nOne of the emerging solutions to blockchain’s user experience crisis is intent-centric/solver-based bridging protocols. Acting as a form of chain abstraction, these protocols operate on an “intent” or specific goal that a user wishes to accomplish within a chain—for example, swapping tokens between two chains without the need to navigate the cross-chain complexities themselves. Instead of having to select a bridge, sign multiple transactions manually, and then monitor the process until the transaction is complete, users are simply required to define their intent, and automated solvers execute the action in the most efficient way possible. Intent-based chain abstraction solutions are becoming an increasingly popular architecture, with many component-based products potentially coming together like puzzle pieces to gradually shape the final form of chain abstraction.\n\nFor example, if a user wants to exchange ETH on Ethereum for USDC on Solana, a solver-based protocol has the capability to identify the best route, align all the necessary approvals, and then complete the transaction—all this without the user being required to make any technical decisions. This drastically reduces the high level of friction users face and improves security by minimizing errors due to manual interventions.\n\nIntent-centric/solver-based bridging protocols aren’t just about simplifying transactions; they are also about making Web3 interactions feel as smooth as traditional Web2 experiences. With these solver-based protocols handling tasks like route optimization and execution, users no longer need to worry about the underlying infrastructure as they simply get their desired result.\n\nFor Web3 to reach a stage of mass adoption, the underlying complexities that users must currently navigate need to be eliminated. While solver-based bridging protocols improve cross-chain interoperability, chain abstraction and zero-knowledge proofs can be implemented in many other ways to make the overall Web3 UX better. While chain abstraction makes blockchain interactions feel seamless, allowing everyday users to engage with dApps without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) enable the verification of information without revealing the information itself, giving individuals and organizations assurance that their information is safe. These technologies eliminate the need for users to switch networks, bridge assets, or manage different token standards. Additionally, these advancements move blockchain technology beyond just technical innovation and into a system that simply works well. If it wasn’t evident already, it should be by now that the most successful technology isn’t the most complex—rather, it’s the one people don’t even realize they’re using. This is reflected in the popularity of these technologies, which are already gaining traction.\n\nThe Web3 industry has spent years and significant resources looking for solutions to improve scalability, security, and interoperability along with building trust. It is now time to bring into sharp focus the evolving needs of users and make this pathbreaking technology accessible to everyday users. If the Web3 ecosystem truly wants to onboard the next billion users, it is time the user experience becomes a key priority and the focus shifts from just building infrastructure.\n\nIt can be said in no clearer words—user experience is the key to mainstream adoption. Solutions like solver-based bridging protocols, chain abstraction, and zero-knowledge proofs represent a fundamental shift in how users are beginning to interact with various blockchains. By prioritizing these innovations, the Web3 ecosystem is on a path where the future of Web3 becomes as seamless as what we all have come to expect with Web2. After all, a billion users won’t adopt blockchain technology because of what it can do—it will only see mainstream adoption when individuals can engage with it without even thinking about it.\n\nSusannah Evans is Product Lead of IBC at the Interchain Foundation, driving blockchain interoperability across 110+ chains.

However, in an intriguing twist, Bitcoin experienced massive short liquidations — usually a sign of a price surge. What's driving this unusual market phenomenon? The answer lies in Bitcoin’s unexpected rally amid this sentiment tug-of-war. Over the past week, Bitcoin's spot price reveals a dramatic swing upwards, catching short traders off guard. But how do the seemingly pessimistic funding rates reconcile with this bullish reality?

    "full_content": "# Congressman Emmer reintroduces Securities Clarity Act to define digital asset regulation\n\nCongressman Tom Emmer reintroduced the Securities Clarity Act on March 26 alongside Rep. Darren Soto, reviving a bipartisan effort to clarify the classification of digital assets under federal securities law.\n\nThe bill aims to clearly distinguish between an “investment contract” and the asset associated with it — an issue at the heart of ongoing regulatory uncertainty that has hindered innovation in the digital asset space.\n\nAt the core of the legislation is the introduction of the term “investment contract asset.”\n\nThis designation would separate the underlying digital asset from the investment contract through which it may have been initially offered, allowing for regulatory treatment to evolve as the asset itself transitions to broader utility or decentralization.\n\nAccording to Emmer:\n\n“Without clear definitions, entrepreneurs can’t accurately assess risks or launch compliant products. Our legislation helps fix that so investors can fully participate in this emerging technology without sacrificing consumer protections.”\n\nSoto echoed that sentiment, emphasizing the need for predictable rules that support both economic growth and responsible oversight. “This bill adds much-needed certainty to a fast-evolving space and helps protect investors while fostering innovation,” he said.\n\nThe Securities Clarity Act’s reintroduction comes amid growing congressional interest in modernizing digital asset regulation under President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nThe bill was previously incorporated into the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act, which passed the House of Representatives in May 2024 with bipartisan support.\n\nIts reappearance signals continued momentum in Congress to establish clearer jurisdiction between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), two agencies that have often clashed over oversight of digital assets.\n\nLawmakers from both parties have increasingly acknowledged the need to define how securities laws apply to digital assets, especially as global competitors adopt more advanced regulatory frameworks.\n\nMany see the Securities Clarity Act as a foundational step in a broader legislative strategy to ensure the US remains a hub for blockchain innovation while protecting investors.\n\nAJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

    "full_content": "# House introduces revised stablecoin legislation with compliance measures and developer protection\n\nThe US House of Representatives introduced an updated version of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act on March 26, substantially revising the February 5 draft.\n\nThe legislation aims to regulate payment stablecoins, introduce new compliance mechanisms, expand oversight powers, and clarify key definitions governing the issuance and use of dollar-backed digital assets.\n\nThe STABLE Act of 2025, formally introduced by Representatives Bryan Steil (R-WI) and French Hill (R-AR), aims to create a federal framework for payment stablecoin issuance.\n\nAdditionally, the bill delineates qualified issuers into federally supervised institutions, nonbank entities approved by the Comptroller, and state-approved entities operating under certified regimes.\n\nThe March 26 revision introduces several substantive changes compared to the initial February draft.\n\nThe updated bill explicitly excludes various financial products, such as securities, deposits, and credit union accounts, from the definition of “payment stablecoin.” This exclusion gives developers and institutions greater legal clarity on what qualifies under the act.\n\nThe new draft mandates monthly reserve attestations verified by registered public accounting firms and requires chief executive and financial officers to certify the accuracy of those reports.\n\nKnowingly submitting false certifications may result in criminal penalties of up to $1 million in fines or 10 years in prison. These certification provisions were not present in the February version.\n\nFurther updates include detailed procedures for reviewing and approving new stablecoin issuers. The revised draft imposes decision deadlines for federal regulators, offers formal appeal rights, and allows applicants to reapply following a denial.\n\nRegulators must also submit annual reports to Congress on the timing of pending applications.\n\nRepresentative Bill Huizenga (R-MI), an original cosponsor, highlighted the bill’s importance on an X post. He said:\n\n“Stablecoins have the potential to simplify our payment systems and revolutionize the way we move money. I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of this bipartisan bill with Representative Bryan Steil and Representative French Hill and look forward to next week’s markup.”\n\nA key addition is the mandate for regulators to initiate rulemaking within 180 days of enactment to define application requirements and streamline approval for well-capitalized entities.\n\nThe bill also provides express protection for issuers using public, decentralized networks, clarifying that such a design choice is not grounds for denial but a critical assurance for developers building on blockchain infrastructure.\n\nBoth the February and March versions aim to exclude payment stablecoins from being classified as securities. However, the newer version more comprehensively amends related statutes under the Advisers Act, Securities Act, Exchange Act, and SIPA to ensure consistent treatment across financial regulations.\n\nThe updated STABLE Act consolidates its treatment of decentralized and non-payment stablecoins into a single study provision and restructures its approach to international interoperability.\n\nUnder the revised Section 10, the Treasury will coordinate with foreign jurisdictions to assess comparability and support cross-border stablecoin use, replacing the earlier draft’s standalone reciprocity section.\n\nThe March 26 bill imposes strict reserve standards on stablecoin issuers, requiring full backing by cash-equivalent assets such as Treasury bills or demand deposits.\n\nIt also prohibits issuers from paying yield to token holders and restricts issuer activities to core functions such as issuance, redemption, and custody services.\n\nTo protect consumers, the bill also includes provisions clarifying that the US government does not insure stablecoins and prohibits any misrepresentation to the contrary. Violations may trigger civil penalties or criminal prosecution under existing federal laws.\n\nThe March 26 revision signals a growing bipartisan consensus in Congress to formalize stablecoin regulation and adapt financial policy to blockchain-native payment systems.\n\nAdditionally, it reflects increased responsiveness to the needs of developers and institutions operating at the intersection of fintech and traditional banking.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee is expected to take up the bill for markup in the coming days. Markup is the period when committee members study the viewpoints and discuss amendments.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

    "full_content": "# Pi Network’s native token falls 73% from ATH amid rising supply\n\nPi Network’s native token PI has crashed roughly 73% less than one month after reaching its all-time high at $2.99 on Feb. 26.\n\nAs of press time, Pi was trading at $0.81, inching closer to its $0.70 launch price on Feb. 20.\n\nThe performance is significantly below the crypto market average performance in the same period, as altcoins corrected 6.9% on average. This makes PI drawdown over 10x deeper than the rest of the market.\n\nPI has been facing pressure from its own token design since users can mint tokens and increase supply by interacting with applications on the network.\n\nA Keyrock report published in December 2024 pointed out that over 90% of token unlocks exert negative price pressure, with effects taking up to 30 days to materialize.\n\nAccording to PiScan, the network will issue over 102 million PI tokens over the next 30 days, averaging 3.4 million daily. This would be more than 1% of PI’s circulating supply.\n\nAt the current price of $0.81, the dollar-denominated supply pressure is $82.6 million — roughly $2.7 million daily.\n\nAccording to a Tokenomist report, Pi Network is responsible for 4% of the $2 billion in token unlocks scheduled for April.\n\nPi Network has been criticized for several reasons in the weeks before and since its launch last month. Industry participants have raised concerns about its operations resembling a multi-level marketing scheme.\n\nThe project’s delayed mainnet launch and limited details on token utility have exacerbated concerns about whether Pi can deliver on its promise of accessible, decentralized value transfer.\n\nBybit CEO Ben Zhou recently drew attention to a report issued by Chinese law enforcement that described Pi as fraudulent.\n\nThe report claimed that the project targeted vulnerable populations, including elderly users, by promising financial gain. It also accused the network of allegedly harvesting its users’ personal data.\n\nThe report further attributed financial losses, including pension depletion, to the project’s influence in China.\n\nSeparately, Moonrock Capital CEO Simon Dedic expressed skepticism over Pi’s reported $26 billion fully diluted valuation and claims that 60% of the supply is already in circulation.\n\nDedic said that the project “has built a strong cult following among non-crypto users who shill it purely for financial reasons.” He further alleged that Pi Network was a “giant Ponzi” that achieved virality through promises of “free money.”\n\nIn a public statement issued on Feb. 22, Pi Network rejected the allegations and clarified its position regarding the Chinese police report.\n\nThe team stated that the report referred to unauthorized third parties falsely associating themselves with Pi and that no authorities had contacted Pi Network itself regarding the matter.\n\nThe project reiterated that it is not affiliated with those actors and emphasized its intention to launch responsibly.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.
