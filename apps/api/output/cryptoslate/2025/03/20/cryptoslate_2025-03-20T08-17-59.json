    "full_content": "# Bitcoin’s on-chain flow is dominated by large value outputs\n\nMarch saw some intriguing shifts in Bitcoin's on-chain activity, revealing the powerful influence of large-scale transactions. As Bitcoin continues to mature, big players dominate its daily volume. While smaller transactions stayed in the shadows, the real drama unfolded in mid and late March. A mystery peak in early-to-mid March saw an unexpected surge in the 1,000BTC to 10,000 BTC band, dwarfing typical transactions. Then, just as things seemed to stabilize, mid-March unveiled another twist: What massive moves shook up the Bitcoin network around March 15 to March 16, and who were the masterminds behind these colossal transfers?

You are the only silver lining to this whole mess.”\n\nHe further committed to ensuring that the Solana Foundation remains focused on its core mission of decentralization and open-source software development rather than engaging in cultural debates.\n\nHis response signals an effort to realign the foundation’s priorities and address community concerns.\n\nThe Solana Foundation faced significant criticism following the release of a promotional video titled “America is Back — Time to Accelerate.”\n\nThe ad, posted on March 17, depicted the US as a man in therapy who struggles to focus on technological advancements like crypto and space travel due to societal discussions on pronouns and gender identity.\n\nHowever, the ad was widely condemned for injecting political discourse into the crypto space.\n\nAndrew Thurman of the Jito Foundation, the entity behind the largest project by total value locked on Solana, emphasized the importance of neutrality in blockchain projects.\n\nAfter facing mounting criticism, the Solana Foundation deleted the video within nine hours of its release. However, by that time, it had already garnered over one million views.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Solana Foundation Vice President of Technology Matt Sorg clarified that only a few individuals were involved in the ad’s production. He responded to concerns from Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran, who questioned how the ad could have passed multiple stages of approval without objections.\n\nCochran further noted that transgender developers have significantly advanced open-source cryptography and security software, arguing that the ad failed to recognize the industry’s history of meritocratic contributions.\n\nSorg explained that most of the production process had been outsourced to external teams and clarified that the ad did not represent the Solana community.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

    "full_content": "# BlackRock exec believes Bitcoin’s price does not reflect its strong institutional demand\n\nInstitutional investment in Bitcoin (BTC) has strengthened, but its price has struggled to reflect the growing demand, according to BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick.\n\nDespite continued adoption by large financial players, Bitcoin has experienced significant ETF outflows and cautious sentiment in early 2025, which have kept prices below previous highs.\n\nMitchnick noted that short-term market behavior and macroeconomic uncertainty have slowed momentum despite optimism surrounding regulatory shifts in Washington initially drove gains,\n\nSpeaking with Yahoo Finance on March 18, Mitchnick argued that Bitcoin’s fundamental characteristics — scarcity, decentralization, and independence from traditional monetary systems — position it as a strong hedge against economic downturns.\n\nHe further suggested that a US recession could serve as a major catalyst for Bitcoin’s next rally.\n\nAccording to Mitchnick:\n\n“A recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin. It’s long liquidity, meaning it benefits from increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, and lower interest rates — all typical features of a recessionary environment.”\n\nMitchnick highlighted that while gold has surged to record highs amid growing economic uncertainty, Bitcoin has not yet mirrored that trend. He attributed this divergence to Bitcoin’s short-term trading trends, where it is often treated as a risk-on asset rather than a store of value.\n\nAdditionally, he explained that recent Bitcoin ETF outflows have been primarily driven by hedge funds unwinding spot-futures arbitrage trades rather than long-term investors exiting the market.\n\nHe emphasizing that institutional confidence in Bitcoin remains strong despite short-term volatility, saying:\n\n“The core long-term holders are still in.”\n\nMitchnick also weighed in on President Donald Trump’s move to establish a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, calling it a strong signal of support for BTC’s unique status within the digital asset space.\n\nHowever, he noted that the specifics of how the government plans to acquire and manage Bitcoin remain unclear, which does not help with the current uncertainty prevalent in the market.\n\nMitchnick also indicated that institutional capital is still flowing into the market. He noted that professional investors appear to be taking advantage of the current dip, with many treating Bitcoin’s price weakness as an accumulation opportunity.\n\nHe said:\n\n“Some of the most sophisticated Bitcoin accumulators we speak with are treating this dip as an opportunity.”\n\nDespite ongoing regulatory uncertainties and security concerns in the broader crypto industry, Mitchnick remained optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term role.\n\nHe also argued that investors will increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional financial instability, potentially driving renewed momentum in the months ahead amid the uncertain economic landscape.\n\nAJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

    "full_content": "# Bitcoin reclaims $85k after Fed signals slowdown in quantitative tightening\n\nBitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $85,000 threshold following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) median forecast of 50 basis-point cuts in interest rates in 2025.\n\nIn addition to signaling potential rate cuts, the Federal Reserve announced plans to slow the pace of its balance sheet runoff, also known as quantitative tightening (QT), beginning April 1.\n\nThe monthly cap on Treasuries maturing without replacement will be reduced to $5 billion, down from the previous $25 billion limit. The announcement caused global markets across the board to surge, including crypto.\n\nBitcoin jumped from $84,235.71 to nearly $86,000 before settling at $85,363 as of press time, based on CryptoSlate data.\n\nDespite Bitcoin’s nearly 2% price increase, not all major altcoins did not react as strongly. Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $2,039.11 after a 0.6% positive variation in the same period, and Cardano (ADA) secured a slight 0.5% growth.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP and BNB showed virtually no price variation. However, Solana (SOL) crossed the $130 threshold and was trading at $133.55 as of press time.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the decision should not be interpreted as a broader policy shift but rather as a technical adjustment to ensure smooth market functioning.\n\nThe updated projections reveal a more cautious stance among FOMC members regarding the pace and extent of rate cuts. The median forecast brings the interest rate to approximately 3.9% by year-end.\n\nNine policymakers anticipate two cuts in 2025, down from 10 in December, while eight now expect only one or no cuts, an increase from four in the previous forecast.\n\nMeanwhile, two members foresee three cuts, a drop from five in December, and none project more than three rate reductions.\n\nLonger-term expectations remain largely unchanged. The median forecast for the federal funds rate at the end of 2026 is 3.4%, while the 2027 projection is 3.1%. The Fed’s longer-run estimate of the neutral interest rate remains steady at 3%.\n\nMoreover, the Fed’s latest economic forecasts indicate slow economic growth. The median 2025 GDP projection was revised downward to 1.7% from 2.1% in December.\n\nThe unemployment rate forecast for 2025 has increased slightly to 4.4% from 4.3%, signaling expectations of modest labor market softening.\n\nThe central bank also adjusted inflation projections upward, expecting the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation rate to reach 2.7% in 2025, up from the previous 2.5% estimate. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy, is projected to rise to 2.8%, compared to the earlier forecast of 2.5%.\n\nDuring his post-meeting press conference, Powell addressed concerns over inflationary pressures, particularly the impact of tariffs.\n\nHe noted that a significant portion of recent inflation upticks could be attributed to tariff-related factors but stated that their long-term impact remains uncertain.\n\nPowell also described tariff-driven inflation as “transitory” but acknowledged the difficulty of assessing its effects. He reiterated that the Fed monitors economic data for any signs of weakness but emphasized that policymakers are not hurrying to cut rates.\n\nWith persistent inflationary pressures and slowing economic growth, the Fed’s latest projections indicate a more measured approach to monetary policy adjustments.\n\nThe central bank’s willingness to slow quantitative tightening while maintaining a cautious stance on rate cuts reflects a balancing act between sustaining economic stability and controlling inflation.\n\nAt the time of press 9:12 pm UTC on Mar. 19, 2025, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 4.21% over the past 24 hours.

    "full_content": "# Crypto.com reports record $1.5B revenue in 2024 to become the third largest exchange\n\nCrypto.com recorded a staggering $1.5 billion in revenue during 2024, with CEO Kris Marszalek attributing the growth to strong trading activity from its 140 million users.\n\nThe exchange’s operational efficiency helped generate approximately $1 billion in gross profit after covering salaries and other expenses.\n\nAmid the impressive revenue figures, Crypto.com invested heavily in expanding its market presence. The company said it allocated around $700 million to user acquisition, incentives, and branding, leaving it with a net profit of $300 million.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange benefited from Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally to new all-time highs since it holds the asset as part of its treasury strategy.\n\nMarszalek noted that Crypto.com plans to reinvest in itself and the broader crypto market, positioning the company for aggressive expansion even in less favorable market conditions.\n\nHe stated:\n\n“We are in position to invest aggressively in the unlikely event of a market downturn, building business organically and through M&A. We intend to do both.”\n\nCrypto.com’s strong financial performance aligns with its rapid expansion.\n\nCoinGecko data ranks it the fastest-growing exchange of 2024, with trading volume surging nearly 1,000% from $120.6 billion in 2023 to $1.29 trillion. This growth positioned Crypto.com as the third-largest exchange, holding a 6.85% market share.\n\nMarszalek attributed this success to the company’s regulatory footprint across 100 jurisdictions spanning five continents.\n\nAccording to him, the crypto exchange holds notable regulatory licenses across different regulatory jurisdictions, including Singapore, the UK, Dubai, and Canada.\n\nIn the US, the exchange holds over 40 state Money Transmitter Licenses, along with registration under the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). It also operates as a designated contract market (DCM) and a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), strengthening its compliance credentials.\n\nLooking ahead, Marszalek confirmed that Crypto.com’s momentum in 2024 will drive its expansion plans for 2025. The company has already made strategic acquisitions and secured licenses to introduce derivatives trading while working on new product offerings.\n\nMarszalek added:\n\n“We are very bullish on our future, particularly in the US market given the new Administration’s enthusiasm for our sector. My meetings with the President give me confidence that he will deliver on his campaign promise to make the US a global leader in cryptocurrency.”\n\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

    "full_content": "# Bitnomial set to launch CFTC-approved XRP futures on March 20, withdraws SEC lawsuit\n\nBitnomial will launch its CFTC-approved XRP futures contracts on March 20 and drop its lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe firm said its decision to withdraw its lawsuit was driven by the regulator’s move to abandon legal action against Ripple.\n\nAccording to the March 19 announcement, the contracts will be physically settled, providing a new regulated trading instrument for institutional and retail investors’ exposure to XRP.\n\nBitnomial clients will gain access to XRP futures immediately at launch. In contrast, prospective clients can onboard through Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) partners, including R.J. O’Brien and Associates, Marex Capital Markets, and Bitnomial Clearing.\n\nThe introduction of these contracts follows the broader trend of increased regulatory clarity in the crypto sector, particularly as legal developments reshape the landscape for digital assets.\n\nOne such development was Ripple’s decisive victory against the SEC. The regulator formally dropped its appeal in the long-standing legal battle over XRP’s classification. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the resolution on March 19, calling it a significant moment for the industry.\n\nInitiated in December 2020, the case accused Ripple of conducting unregistered securities sales worth $1.3 billion. A key ruling in August 2024 determined that XRP is not a security when traded on public exchanges, although penalties were upheld for institutional sales.\n\nThe ruling ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in penalties, significantly lower than the SEC’s original demand of nearly $2 billion.\n\nThe regulator and Ripple appealed the decision, with the SEC ultimately deciding to let go of its appeal. However, Ripple’s appeal to avoid the fine and clear XRP’s status as security on institutional sales is still up.\n\nIn tandem with the launch of its XRP futures, Bitnomial announced it has voluntarily dropped its lawsuit against the SEC.\n\nThe firm had sued the regulator in October 2024 over jurisdictional disputes concerning futures contracts based on XRP’s price.\n\nBitnomial initially filed for its XRP futures product in August 2024 after the federal ruling that XRP is not a security, challenging the SEC’s stance on overseeing XRP derivatives.\n\nThe firm’s decision to dismiss its case is based on the shifting regulatory environment and improving clarity regarding digital asset classification.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

    "full_content": "# Trump’s crypto Czar slams media for misrepresenting divestment as dump\n\nWhite House AI and crypto advisor David Sacks criticized claims that he “dumped” his crypto holdings and clarified that, after being appointed by President Donald Trump, he was required to divest due to government ethics rules.\n\nIn a March 19 social media post, Sacks addressed recent reports suggesting he had sold off his Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) investments, stating that the characterization was misleading.\n\n“I did not ‘dump’ my cryptocurrency; I divested it. Obviously, I would have preferred not to, but government ethics rules required it. It’s an honor to serve President Trump and the American people.”\n\nAccording to a White House memo, Sacks liquidated more than $200 million in digital assets before Trump took office. His firm, Craft Ventures, also exited positions in crypto-related stocks, including Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD), and the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund.\n\nThe move came amid scrutiny over Sacks’ role in the administration, with some speculating that his influence played a part in discussions about incorporating certain cryptocurrencies into a potential US digital asset reserve.\n\nSacks’ clarification reignited discussions about how crypto is portrayed in the media. Some industry figures argue that skepticism about digital assets influences how news outlets frame stories.\n\nBankless HQ co-founder David Hoffman suggested that negative headlines reflect broader public sentiment rather than deliberate bias.\n\nHoffman wrote in response to Sacks’ post:\n\n“Most people are crypto-less and don’t want crypto to do well because they don’t want to hold cognitive dissonance about making any wealth in crypto. Media is titling headlines to cater to this need.”\n\nBinance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao echoed the sentiment and said media outlets prioritize engagement over accuracy.\n\nCZ wrote:\n\n“The media only sells clicks, not ethics.”\n\nHe also criticized a recent Wall Street Journal report alleging that the Trump family considered acquiring a stake in Binance US in exchange for a pardon, calling the story baseless.\n\nAJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

    "full_content": "# Tom Emmer says 1M Bitcoin reserve will be enacted under current Congress\n\nCongressman and Vice Chairman of the Digital Assets Subcommittee Tom Emmer believes the strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve plan to acquire 1 million BTC will be enacted before the end of this Congress.\n\nWhile participating in the Digital Asset Summit, he acknowledged the multiple bills to implement state-level Bitcoin reserves. According to data from the Bitcoin Laws, 23 US states have legislation proposing Bitcoin reserves.\n\nEmmer said:\n\n“So, yes, there is legislation. And I believe that before this Congress is done, that will be enacted.”\n\nHe also shared that the Digital Assets Subcommittee is deeply interested in stablecoins, as they represent an “enhanced form of currency” and expand access to the US dollar.\n\nRegarding the Bitcoin reserve, Emmer referenced the recently reintroduced BITCOIN Act, authored by Senator Cynthia Lummis and cosponsored by five Republican Senators.\n\nThe legislation authorizes the US government to add up to 1 million BTC to its treasury over five years, funded by the Federal Reserve’s net earnings and adjustments to Treasury certificates based on the Fed’s gold holdings.\n\nThe amount acquired would then be held for at least 20 years, managed by the Treasury Department. The bill allows divesting, although it prevents any Treasury Secretary from reducing more than 10% of the reserve within a two-year timeframe.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plans were introduced in an executive order signed on March 7 and are separate from legislative efforts being made by lawmakers.\n\nThe executive order focuses on maintaining Bitcoin seized by US authorities as a long-term store of value and does not establish timeframes for acquiring or holding BTC. Estimates suggest that the US currently has nearly 200,000 BTC.\n\nAdditionally, it mandates that any Bitcoin purchase should happen through budget-neutral strategies devised by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

    "full_content": "# First Solana ETFs in the US set for trading debut on March 20\n\nVolatility Shares will launch the first-ever Solana (SOL) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US on March 20, Bloomberg News reported on March 19.\n\nThe issuer will introduce two products: the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT).\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas compared them to Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs BITO and BITX. He also noted that the launch is unlikely to live up to the standards set by spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nHe added:\n\n“It’s the first altcoin after Ethereum to be approved. But history has shown that ETF investors crave holding the physical asset as much as possible.”\n\nSOLZ will provide exposure to Solana futures, while SOLT will offer leveraged exposure at twice the returns of Solana futures movements. The ETFs carry expense ratios of 0.95% and 1.85%, respectively.\n\nVolatility Shares initially submitted its application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in December, continuing the trend of crypto-based ETFs predicted by Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart.\n\nVolatility Shares CEO Justin Young credited the launch to “renewed optimism for crypto innovation in the US” brought by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nWhile the SEC has not approved a spot Solana ETF, industry analysts see these futures-based funds as a potential precursor. Bitcoin and Ethereum took a similar path, with issuers introducing futures ETFs before gaining approval for spot ETFs.\n\nThe first Solana futures started trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on March 17.\n\nK33 head of research Vetle Lunde highlighted that the launch day volumes of SOL futures reached $12.3 million, significantly below BTC’s $102.7 million and ETH’s $31 million.\n\nOpen interest was also substantially smaller, with SOL futures reaching nearly $8 million, while BTC and ETH reached at least $20 million in their launches.\n\nDespite the seemingly lackluster numbers, Lunde said that by normalizing volumes to the assets’ market caps at launch days, Solana aligns with both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

    "full_content": "# Czech central banker questions Bitcoin’s place as a reserve asset amid volatility concerns\n\nJan Kubíček, a Czech National Bank’s (CNB) board member, has reportedly questioned Bitcoin’s suitability as a reserve asset.\n\nHe pointed to its legal uncertainty and price instability as key reasons for skepticism, casting doubt on whether the bank will integrate the digital asset into its portfolio.\n\nAccording to the report, Kubíček acknowledged that Bitcoin is under review as part of the CNB’s reserve diversification plan. However, he expressed concerns about its legal status, noting that adopting it would require overhauling the bank’s accounting and auditing systems.\n\nThe banking experts further argued that incorporating Bitcoin into the reserve structure presents significant challenges without clear regulations.\n\nMarket volatility remains another primary concern. Kubíček pointed out that BTC’s fluctuating price, which has ranged from $77,186 to $109,021 this year, complicates risk assessments.\n\nHe also suggested that if more institutional investors adopt BTC, its behavior could shift, making future volatility harder to predict.\n\nHe added:\n\n“We cannot be certain that Bitcoin’s volatility in the coming years will mirror the patterns observed over the past decade because I suspect that, if more institutional investors accept Bitcoin as an investment asset, it will start to behave differently from what we have seen so far.”\n\nKubíček’s position differs from that of CNB Governor Ales Michl, who has been pushing to add Bitcoin to the bank’s reserves.\n\nEarlier this year, Michl proposed that BTC could be a strategic asset for diversification. If approved, the CNB could allocate up to 5% of its $146.13 billion reserves to Bitcoin, translating to an estimated $7.3 billion investment—far exceeding its current $4.3 million gold holdings.\n\nMichl has also argued that central banks should explore Bitcoin’s potential rather than dismiss it outright. He believes that BTC and its underlying technology could enhance rather than disrupt financial stability.\n\nMeanwhile, Kubíček confirmed that the CNB is still studying BTC and other emerging asset classes. The findings, expected by October, will likely determine whether BTC gains a foothold in the Czech Republic’s reserve strategy or remains an unlikely candidate.\n\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.
