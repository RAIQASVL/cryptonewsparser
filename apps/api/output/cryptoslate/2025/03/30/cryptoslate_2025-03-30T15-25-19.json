    "full_content": "# Made in the USA: OpenAI’s strategy to keep American AI competitive\n\nThe following is a guest post from Ahmad Shadid, Founder of O.xyz.\n\nIn an era where artificial intelligence dictates global power dynamics, OpenAI is making bold moves to secure America’s dominance in the sector. Its new plan called the “AI Action Plan,” tries to ease the regulatory framework, implement export controls, and increase federal investment to stay ahead of China’s AI expansion.\n\nOpenAI signed a deal with the Trump administration for the new “AI Action Plan” on March 13. The deal revolved around limited regulatory oversight and rapid development of AI in the US.\n\nThe proposal highlights a fundamental truth: too much state-level regulation might undermine America’s leadership in AI, even as China’s state-supported AI players — led by DeepSeek — continue to grow rapidly.\n\nDeepSeek’s R1 model, released in January 2025, performed at the level of top US AI systems — though having been developed at a much lower cost — challenging the American tech giants’ dominance.\n\nThis proved to be a major sell-off in US tech stocks, with firms such as Nvidia suffering huge losses. Soon after, the US government raised red flags about national security and data privacy, debating on policy solutions to keep America out front in the very technologies it wrote the rules for.\n\nOpenAI’s approach represents a pivotal point in American AI policy, combining regulatory advocacy with industrial ambition to ensure the US stays on top of the game when it comes to AI. Moreover, at the heart of OpenAI’s plan is an export-control strategy that aims to limit the country’s expanding influence in China.\n\nThis will prevent the misuse of AI platforms and technologies by opposing nations. Consequently, the export controls will protect the US national security.\n\nOpenAI’s plan also calls for using federal dollars to explain to the world that American-made AI is safer and that US-based companies should stay ahead of the international AI stream.\n\nDeepSeek is not only a Chinese AI initiative and a commercial competitor but also a fundamental ally of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In late January, DeepSeek grew infamous for blocking information on the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, riding a wave of screenshots on social media pointing out China’s censorship.\n\nA central part of OpenAI’s pitch is locking in greater federal funding for AI infrastructure. This means ensuring that the high-water mark for American progress in the field of AI does not merely concern protecting what comes next from foreign threats but also reinforces the necessary computational and data infrastructure to sustain long-term growth.\n\nThe Stargate Project, for instance, is a joint effort by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX that will provide up to $500 billion for the development of AI infrastructure in the United States.\n\nThis ambitious initiative is intended to cement American AI superiority while producing thousands of domestic jobs — much against the belief of the ‘AI might replace your job’ narrative.\n\nIt is a major tactical shift in the approach to AI policy, acknowledging that private sector investments are not enough to remain competitive compared to state-sponsored efforts like China’s DeepSeek.\n\nThe Stargate Project wants to ensure the construction of advanced data centers and the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing within the United States to keep AI development domestic in the US.\n\nIn its early stages, Federal support for AI infrastructure is critical — both for growing economic competitiveness and for national security. AI-powered features are often used in national defense and intelligence. For instance, Shield AI’s Nova is an autonomous quadcopter drone that uses AI to fly itself through complex environments without GPS to gather life-saving information in combat environments.\n\nFurthermore, AI is also critical in cyber defense against hacking, phishing, ransomware, and other cybersecurity threats because it can identify deviations or abnormalities in systems in real time. Hence, its role in detecting patterns and spotting irregularities helps the US safeguard critical defense infrastructure from cyberattacks, making it all the more important to fast-track AI’s growth for defense.\n\nA key element of OpenAI’s proposal is the call for a new copyright approach that would ensure that American AI models can access copyrighted material for use in their training. The ability to train on a wide range of datasets is vital to keeping AI models sophisticated.\n\nIf the copyright policies are restrictive, it could put the US at a disadvantage to their foreign competitors — especially the Chinese ones, which operate among weaker copyright enforcement.\n\nAI tools are evaluated for risk, governance board scrutiny, and compliance verification frameworks such as the House AI Policy and DHS conditional approvals. Although FedRAMP’s ‘fast pass’ may expedite deployment, antennae from the FTC and regulations will keep AI’s purposes on the same shelf as national security policy and consumer protections.\n\nThese safeguards, while no doubt very important, often slow the pace of AI adoption in crucial government use cases.\n\nNow, OpenAI, in particular, is lobbying for a partnership between the government and the industry, where AI companies voluntarily contribute their models’ data, and in exchange, they would not be liable to strong state restrictions.\n\nThough OpenAI’s proposal is bold and ambitious, it poses serious questions about how much regulation can help in driving innovation in this burgeoning sector.\n\nWhile weakening state-level regulatory oversight will leave room for faster AI developments, there is a significant concern yet to be resolved. The partnership structure of AI organizations with the federal government could create the potential for private firms to exercise outsized power over the nation’s policies on AI and the users themselves.\n\nRegardless of these fears, one thing is clear: the United States cannot afford to fall behind its competitors in AI development. If done right, this partnership could guarantee that American AI stays the dominant framework worldwide rather than yielding ground to foreign government-controlled competitors like China’s DeepSeek.\n\nAhmad Shadid, founder of O.XYZ and former CEO of IO.net, transformed IO.net into a multibillion-dollar decentralized AI infrastructure leader, driving blockchain and AI innovation with scalable, cost-efficient solutions for real-world applications.\n\nCryptoSlate is a comprehensive and contextualized source for crypto news, insights, and data.

    "full_content": "# Is the altcoin market in even deeper trouble?\n\nThe following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief fromThe Tokenist.\n\nIf anything can be learned from the crypto market is that if a shortcut exists, it will be taken. When digital collectibles in the form of NFTs emerged, the market was quickly saturated. In turn, speculative NFT buys on their resell potential shifted into a market rout.\n\nSimilarly with memecoins, no matter the rug pulls and pump and dumps, the allure of a quick buck on the ride up demonstrated the ruinous combination of low barrier to entry plus high hype potential.\n\nBut what about the altcoin market itself, outside of memecoins and NFTs? Is there a broader lesson, or even a threat, now that AI is an inextricable part of life? First, let’s examine what happens with NFTs as an enlightening parallel.\n\nJust prior to Terra (LUNA) collapse in May 2022, global NFT sales reached nearly $24 billion. The optimism was so high that JP Morgan projected $1 trillion in annual metaverse revenue within a decade. That forecast now seems completely out of place.\n\nAlthough the cascade of bankruptcies, from Celsius to BlockFi and FTX, acted as a trigger for NFT market collapse, the writing was already on the wall. AI-powered image generators such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E have drastically lowered the barrier to entry, opening the floodgates for derivative low-effort NFT collections.\n\nSuch AI-powered saturation drastically eroded the scarcity of collectibles, which ultimately drove down speculative PFP (profile picture) projects in favor of utility-driven NFTs and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).\n\nAltogether, the AI availability greatly exacerbated the underlying weakness of the NFT market – oversupply. This problem is now easy to see, as Ghibli mania is sweeping the social media space, generated by both ChatGPT and Grok.\n\nIn turn, the collapsing profit-making from NFTs induced speculation fatigue. Memecoins have mirrored this dynamic quite closely, with the help of additional AI-powered layers:\n\nThe ultimate result of AI amplification is the creation of a market that is highly prone to bubble bursts. Consequently, repeated bursts cause exhaustion and ever-decreasing retail engagement — especially when participants are lured by hype rather than guided by sound risk management. But the question is, could this type of crypto exhaustion infect the altcoin market outside NFTs and memecoins, on a deeper level?\n\nFor years, it has been common to measure the underlying value of a blockchain project by developer involvement. This developer activity then serves as a signal toward prospective tokenholders. After all, if a project has few core developers, there is much greater risk the project will suffer if they leave.\n\nIn turn, there would be less effort going into bug hunting, new features, roadmap implementation and optimization. This is why many dedicated websites exist to expose this metric, tracking developer commits across different time periods.\n\nIn short, developer activity measures blockchain’s health status. As developers seek incentives, it may even reveal the blockchain’s adoption potential as their key long-term value driver.\n\nBut with AI in play, we are looking at a significant distortion potential. Over the last year, it has been widely accepted that AI models, alongside image generation, are at their best when it comes to coding. Specifically, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 has been well received as a coding multiplier, capable of replacing junior software engineers.\n\nThis opens an entirely new landscape in which few senior developers can leverage their AI underlings to:\n\nAnd just as it happened with NFTs and memecoins, the lower the barrier to entry, the higher the oversupply potential. AI keeps lowering that barrier to entry, with the capacity for a full blockchain project pipeline, from smart contract code to social media boost.\n\nIt may even be the case that AI could fabricate smart contract audits by generating false confidence. When it comes to developer activity metric, AI tools can easily distort it with auto-generated commits and pull requests, or even fake GitHub accounts that generate minor and frequent updates.\n\nConsequently, as new tokens come in the spotlight, it will be more difficult to assess its true value and health.\n\nEven in the early stage, AI models are becoming replacement-worthy when it comes to coding. This opens the door for churning out tokens with minimal effort, once again repeating the NFT-like cycle of flooding the market with low-utility tokens.\n\nThis will inevitably cause more exhaustion and disillusionment with the crypto space, as it will be more difficult to filter AI noise. By the same token, there will be advantages:\n\nUltimately, AI cannot sustainably fake adoption. Rather, AI will serve as a filtering mechanism to purge weak projects.\n\nUnfortunately, memecoin activity over the last few years clearly shows that people seek out early opportunities in hopes of getting the coveted 10x profit lock-in. This is not an investor mindset but a quick buck mindset. Therefore, this driver will maintain incentives to use AI for crypto project generation for no other purpose than to extract wealth.\n\nYet, in the opposite direction, blockchain projects will also provide solutions. Case in point, OriginTrail (TRAC) project is leveraging Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) to ensure verifiability of information used by AI.\n\n“Even abusing social networks for political manipulations may look minuscule compared to a lack of trust in solutions to which we are “outsourcing” our cognition. Systems that we would trust to process large amounts of knowledge and provide us inputs for our actions or even perform certain actions autonomously, have the highest possible requirements for transparency and verifiability.”\n\nTrace Labs whitepaper Verifiable Internet for Artificial Intelligence: The Convergence of Crypto, Internet and AI\n\nLong-term, it would be prudent to expect further erosion of trust in the altcoin market. After all, it is likely that mass-produced, unaudited contracts will lead to not just rug pulls, but costly hacks. Onchain reputation efforts from Karma3Labs may help, but it is unclear if such innovative solutions could move beyond niche adoption.\n\nSince 2015, Shane fervently backs decentralized finance, penning countless articles on digital securities and the fusion of traditional finance with DLT. He's intrigued by technology's influence on economics and life.\n\nCryptoSlate is a comprehensive and contextualized source for crypto news, insights, and data.

    "full_content": "# Crypto exchanges at risk: What the industry must learn from the largest Bybit hack\n\nThe following is a guest post from Michael Egorov, Founder of Curve Finance.\n\nThe recent Bybit hack saw a grand total of $1.5 billion lost in crypto assets and has become the biggest hack in the entire history of this industry. The thing that makes this breach particularly concerning is that hackers targeted Bybit’s cold storage — typically the most secure part of an exchange’s infrastructure.\n\nWhile Bybit moved quickly to replenish its reserves with the help of partners, the whole event still left many people shaken up. This situation once again raises security concerns. How vulnerable are crypto exchanges and what lessons should the industry take from this breach?\n\nThe way I see it, this incident is more than just another attack — it’s a wake-up call exposing the systemic security flaws of centralized exchanges. Despite implementing strict security measures, CEX platforms remain prime targets for hackers. Why? Precisely because of their centralized nature.\n\nUnlike in DeFi, where user funds are distributed across self-custodial wallets, centralized platforms store assets in a controlled infrastructure. This creates a possibility of a single point of failure, where breaching a single layer of security can give attackers easy access to vast amounts of funds. After that, it’s pretty much over. Any recovery of funds has to rely on centralized oversight, assistance of external agents and sheer luck.\n\nChainalysis report clearly shows that in 2024, centralized services were the most targeted, marking a notable shift from DeFi hacks to CeFi. This is further confirmed by Hacken’s data that CeFi breaches more than doubled in the previous year, leading to the loss of almost $700 million. Access control vulnerabilities were highlighted among the primary causes of breaches.\n\nThis confirms that exchanges need to rethink their approach to security.\n\nThe good thing about DeFi platforms is that their very nature minimizes the risks we covered above. Instead of relying on a centralized infrastructure, DeFi protocols leverage smart contracts and cryptographic security mechanisms to protect assets. This eliminates the possibility of centralized points of failure — there’s no single entity that can be exploited to drain user funds.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that DeFi isn’t without risks of its own. Since it operates in a permissionless environment, hackers are always present. And since transactions are irreversible, the only true protection is flawless code. Poorly written code can lead to vulnerabilities, but if there are no errors, then hackers can’t take advantage of them to break in.\n\nHacken’s 2024 security report indicates that smart contract exploits accounted for just 14% of crypto losses in 2024. This is why I believe that smart contract audits are essential to ensure the highest possible security standards.\n\nSince artificial intelligence is becoming a more heated topic every day, there are many in the crypto market who wonder what role it will play in security. So I’m going to offer my two cents on the subject.\n\nFirst of all, AI tools have not yet been developed to the point where they would be effective in such tasks. But when they come around to that level, it is very likely that they will be effective.\n\nProperly developed AI tools can potentially be highly useful when it comes to simulating and analyzing the execution of smart contracts. In other words, they can help detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, allowing developers to patch security holes well before hackers come knocking.\n\nAutomated testing and AI-assisted audits can also significantly enhance security standards, making both DeFi and CeFi systems more robust. But it would be wise not to rely completely on artificial intelligence in such matters – even this tech can miss things.\n\nAt the same time, AI tools can also be weaponized by hackers to scan systems and identify flaws to exploit faster than ever before. This will inevitably mean an arms race between security teams and hackers where platforms will have to constantly stay one step ahead.\n\nAnd the one thing I would absolutely advise against is using AI to write the actual smart contracts. Given the current level of development of this technology, AI-written code cannot yet match human developers in quality or security.\n\nBy now, all centralized exchanges implement industry best practices, such as multisignature wallets and other security protocols. However, as the Bybit hack has shown, these measures don’t seem to be enough on their own.\n\nCEXs inherently create centralized points of failure. While they should be highly secured, they remain single points of attack, making them attractive targets for hackers. One potential solution to this problem could be introducing user-controlled wallets with extra layers of oversight managed by the exchanges. However, it is also well-known that self-custody and key management is extremely inconvenient for most users. So that’s not a particularly safe approach.\n\nIn that case, what can exchanges do differently on their side of things?\n\nFirst of all, we need to recognize that many security mechanisms used by these platforms today, including multisignature wallets, rely on Web 2.0 technologies. This means that their security depends on not just how robust the smart contracts are, but also on the safety of web-based frontends. The UIs that users interact with and through which those smart contracts are accessed.\n\nIssues in frontend security can undermine the entire system, if hackers find a way to compromise it. But ensuring security here is a challenge and a half. Web applications often rely on thousands of dependencies (Uniswap’s UI, for example, has over 4,500), all of which represent a potential attack vector. If even one of these dependencies gets compromised, hackers could inject malicious code into the interface without ever needing to attack the core system.\n\nAs such, developers must ensure that not only their own code is safe but also every piece of software their platform depends on.\n\nA good solution would be for large exchanges to use self-hosted Web UIs. They do exist, including for the Safe wallet, in particular. An even better option would be to use specially designed software that bypasses traditional web technologies altogether when interacting with smart contracts. For example, there is an official CLI tool for Safe wallets, which significantly reduces the number of dependencies (by a factor of about 100), bringing down the risk of supply chain attacks.\n\nAdditionally, all signing for high-value transactions should be conducted on isolated machines used exclusively for this purpose and nothing else. Doing so minimizes the risk of the human factor playing a role in compromising the signing infrastructure with malware. Another approach could be leveraging containerized operating systems like QubesOS — they are quite exotic at the moment, but do offer enhanced security as part of their design philosophy.\n\nAnd, of course, while hardware wallets are the standard practice that everyone uses, when high-value transactions are involved, it is critical that exchanges implement mechanisms to verify what, exactly, these wallets are signing. Currently, hardware wallets do not make this task easy, but there are tools available in the market that can assist in verifying transaction data before execution.\n\nAll in all, implementing any of these measures is no simple feat — this is a truth that has to be acknowledged. Perhaps the industry as a whole needs to establish formalized security recommendations or even develop specialized operating systems tailored for safe interaction with crypto out of the box.\n\nBut it is also true that without significant upgrades to security infrastructure, the risks posed to CEXs will only continue to grow.\n\nMichael Egorov, physicist and entrepreneur, founded Curve Finance, a leading decentralized exchange for efficient stablecoin trading.

    "full_content": "# Fidelity says Bitcoin could potentially overtake gold, echoing Saylor’s absorption theory\n\nFidelity Investments director of global macro Jurrien Timmer believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has a “possible” path to surpassing gold in market value — but “not any time soon.”\n\nIn a detailed social media post, Timmer explained his view using a chart comparing the projected growth of gold and Bitcoin over time.\n\nHe noted that if gold continues to grow at its historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% — a trend seen since 1970 — and Bitcoin follows either a power law adoption curve or the internet’s S-curve growth model, the two could converge within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nTimmer wrote:\n\n“If Bitcoin grows at the rate suggested by these two models, then hard money is likely winning the race, which suggests that gold will be appreciating faster than 8% per year. So, my guess is that gold will always be Bitcoin’s quieter older sibling.”\n\nThe prediction is much more cautious than forecasts shared by other industry leaders like Galaxy and Strategy founder Michael Saylor.\n\nTimmer’s comments come amid significant volatility in crypto markets. Bitcoin fell below $84,000 again on March 28, equating to a roughly 33% decline against gold since its December peak.\n\nThe price struggles come as inflation concerns and trade tensions continue to weigh on risk assets amid the subdued market sentiment. Meanwhile, gold continues to reach new all-time highs, reinforcing its long-standing role as a safe haven.\n\nDespite Bitcoin’s price decline, major institutions continue to show confidence in the asset. On March 27, Fidelity and BlackRock drove a combined $89 million into Bitcoin ETFs, led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $97.1 million in inflows.\n\nThe continued capital injection signals growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects — even as near-term price action paints a more bearish picture.\n\nWhile Timmer offered a measured take, Strategy founder Michael Saylor recently presented a far more aggressive forecast.\n\nSpeaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 28, Saylor predicted Bitcoin’s market cap could soar to $500 trillion as it absorbs value from traditional assets like gold, real estate, and even sovereign wealth.\n\nSaylor argued that Bitcoin is replacing “20th-century assets” with a digital, decentralized, inflation-resistant alternative. He compared the shift to historic changes in monetary systems  — like European colonizers introducing coinage to societies that used beads or shells.\n\nSaylor added that the US has the “opportunity to grab” 25% to 30% of global Bitcoin value once the “dust settles” from this asset reorganization.\n\nStill, the debate is clearly shifting. As more institutional money flows in and long-term models project exponential adoption, the conversation is no longer whether Bitcoin belongs in the same conversation as gold — but when and under what conditions it might catch up.\n\nFor now, Fidelity’s Timmer urged caution and said the flippening is “possible,” but gold — steady, quiet, and time-tested — still holds the upper hand.\n\nAJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

Delo, the firm’s former strategy chief, was sentenced to 30 months of probation, while Reed, who served as CTO, received an 18-month term of probation.\n\nTrump’s pardons arrived just over three months after BitMEX itself agreed to pay $100 million to settle allegations that it failed to maintain required compliance programs for detecting and preventing money laundering.\n\nFederal prosecutors had accused the company’s leadership of ignoring legal obligations while continuing to court business from American traders. According to court filings, BitMEX allowed users to register with only an email address and failed to enforce its stated ban on U.S. customers.\n\nIn a statement after the pardon was announced, Delo said the charges stemmed from what he called an outdated law and a politicized enforcement effort. He described the pardons as a “vindication” and claimed the trio should never have been prosecuted.\n\nDelo:\n\n“We were wrongfully made to serve as an example.”\n\nHayes, Delo and Reed had each paid $10 million in criminal fines as part of their plea deals, in addition to a $30 million civil penalty imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nThe White House has not issued a formal comment on the pardons.\n\nFounded in 2014, BitMEX became one of the earliest and most influential derivatives exchanges in the crypto industry, offering users high-leverage trading products with minimal registration requirements.\n\nAt its peak, the exchange processed billions in daily volume, attracting users worldwide, including those in the United States.\n\nFederal authorities began investigating BitMEX as part of a broader crackdown on offshore platforms catering to American traders without proper compliance programs.\n\nIn 2020, the US Department of Justice and the CFTC filed parallel actions against the exchange and its founders.

    "full_content": "# Protocols must prove demand as stablecoin liquidity per token falls 99%\n\nThe average stablecoin liquidity per token declined from $1.8 million in 2021 to just $5,500 in March 2025, a 99.7% drop, forcing protocols to demonstrate sound reasons for investors to hold.\n\nAccording to a recent report by research firm Decentralised, the drop illustrates how rising token issuance, now surpassing 40 million assets, has diluted available capital without a corresponding increase in demand or user retention.\n\nThe report frames this trend as evidence of a zero-sum dynamic in crypto capital allocation, where the influx of new tokens outpaces the expansion of capital pools, resulting in lower liquidity, weaker communities, and diminished engagement.\n\nWithout durable revenue sources, user interest frequently dissipates following short-term incentives such as airdrops. Without sustainable economic structures, attention has become a liability rather than an asset.\n\nThe report used stablecoin liquidity as a proxy for capital availability. It highlighted that the stagnation of new capital inflows amid surging token counts has left many crypto projects undercapitalized.\n\nWith fewer resources per token, the traditional 2021-era playbook — launching a community through Discord servers and airdrop campaigns — no longer produces lasting engagement.\n\nInstead, the report argues, projects must now demonstrate product-market fit and sustained demand through revenue generation.\n\nRevenue functions as a financial metric and as a mechanism for signaling relevance and economic utility. Protocols that generate and retain cash flows are better positioned to justify token valuations, establish governance legitimacy, and maintain user participation.\n\nThe report distinguished between mature platforms like Ethereum (ETH), which rely on ecosystem depth and native incentives, and newer protocols that must earn their place through consistent performance and transparent operations.\n\nThe report outlined four maturity stages for crypto projects: Explorers, Climbers, Titans, and Seasonals. Each category represents a different relationship to capital formation, risk tolerance, and value distribution.\n\nExplorers are early-stage protocols operating with centralized governance and volatile, incentive-driven revenue. While some, such as Synthetix and Balancer, show short-term spikes in usage, their primary goal remains survival rather than profitability.\n\nClimbers, with annual revenue between $10 million and $50 million, begin transitioning from emissions-based growth to user retention and ecosystem governance. These projects must navigate strategic decisions around growth versus distribution while preserving momentum.\n\nTitans — such as Aave, Uniswap, and Hyperliquid — generate consistent revenue, have decentralized governance structures, and operate with strong network effects. Their focus is category dominance, not diversification. Due to the Titans’ established treasuries and operational discipline, they can afford to conduct token buybacks or other value-return programs.\n\nSeasonals, by contrast, are short-lived phenomena driven by hype cycles and social momentum. Projects like FriendTech and PumpFun experience brief periods of high activity but struggle to maintain user interest or revenue consistency over the long-term.\n\nWhile some may evolve, most remain speculative plays without enduring infrastructure relevance.\n\nDrawing parallels with public equity markets, the report noted that younger firms typically reinvest earnings while mature firms return capital via dividends or buybacks.\n\nIn crypto, this distinction is similarly tied to protocol maturity. Titans are well-positioned to implement buybacks or structured distributions, while Explorers and Climbers are advised to focus on reinvestment until operational fundamentals are secured.\n\nAccording to the report, buybacks are a flexible distribution tool that is particularly suited for projects with volatile revenue or seasonal demand patterns.\n\nHowever, the report cautioned that poorly executed buybacks can benefit short-term traders over long-term holders. Effective buyback programs require strong treasury reserves, valuation discipline, and transparent execution. Without these, distribution can erode trust and misallocate capital.\n\nThe trend mirrors broader shifts in traditional markets. In 2024, buybacks accounted for roughly 60% of corporate profit distribution, outpacing dividends.\n\nThis approach allows firms to modulate capital return according to market conditions, but governance risks remain if the incentives driving buyback decisions are misaligned.\n\nThe report identified investor relations (IR) as a critical but underdeveloped function across crypto projects. Despite public claims of transparency, most teams release financial data selectively.\n\nTo build durable trust with token holders and institutional participants, a more institutional approach, including quarterly reporting, real-time dashboards, and clear token distribution disclosures, is needed.\n\nLeading projects are beginning to implement these standards. Aave’s “Buy and Distribute” program, backed by a $95 million treasury, allocates $1 million weekly for structured buybacks.\n\nHyperliquid dedicates 54% of revenue to buybacks and 46% to LP incentives, using revenue alone without external venture funding. Jupiter introduced the Litterbox Trust as a non-custodial mechanism to manage $9.7 million in JUP for future distributions only after reaching financial sustainability.\n\nThese examples show that responsible capital allocation depends on timing, governance, and communication, not just market conditions. As token liquidity per asset continues to decline, the pressure on projects to prove viability through cash flow and transparency will likely intensify.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.”\n\nThe FDIC said it will continue working with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets to issue additional guidance and coordinate with other regulatory agencies to replace prior interagency documents on digital assets.\n\nThe Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets Markets, Bo Hines, called the decision “a huge step forward toward innovation and adoption.”\n\nThe agency’s decision reflects a broader effort to reset its approach to financial innovation.\n\nIn recent years, several banks pursuing digital asset activities reportedly received informal “pause” letters instructing them to halt engagement with crypto services, including custody, tokenized deposits, and even basic retail crypto offerings.\n\nCrypto industry figures said these decisions were a part of “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged effort by former President Joe Biden’s administration to hinder the crypto industry’s growth in the US.\n\nHill has criticized the actions for lacking transparency and contributing to a perception that the FDIC discouraged innovation through non-public enforcement tactics.\n\nIn a January speech, he acknowledged that the agency had failed to offer banks clear public guidance, opting instead for ad hoc interventions.\n\nHe cited the over 20 cases where banks had received letters asking them to stop or delay crypto-related activities without formal rulemaking or open comment periods.\n\nCall to reevaluate\n\nHill emphasized that compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act should not be used as a pretext for denying access to banking services and called for a reevaluation of how the BSA is implemented across financial institutions.\n\nRecent internal discussions at the FDIC haven reortedly focused on allowing banks to pursue tokenized deposit services and other blockchain-based financial infrastructure without unnecessary regulatory delays.\n\nThe move brings the FDIC into closer alignment with other regulators, such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has begun formalizing crypto regulatory frameworks.\n\nIt also comes amid growing pressure from industry participants and lawmakers for banking regulators to provide a consistent, transparent roadmap for lawful crypto-related services.\n\nGino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

It will further enable the development of innovative digital products, services, and new business models, while reducing cost and increasing access to international markets.”\n\nThis move represents a significant step forward in the UAE’s broader digital transformation strategy.\n\nThe UAE has also introduced updated symbols for its national currency to align with its growing focus on digital finance.\n\nThe new symbol for the physical Dirham features a bold capital “D” crossed by two horizontal lines. These lines represent the country’s vision for economic stability and growth. The design takes cues from the national flag, reinforcing the UAE’s confidence in its financial future. For the digital version, a circular frame in the UAE flag’s colors surrounds the “D” symbol.\n\nThe design is intended to reflect the country’s ambition to lead in blockchain innovation and digital financial services.\n\nBalama described the updated branding as a signal of progress and a key part of the country’s digital agenda. He emphasized that the Digital Dirham will improve financial resilience, inclusion, and regulatory oversight while enabling the development of new products and services.\n\nMeanwhile, this announcement follows the CBUAE’s recent membership in the Global Foreign Exchange Committee. It is the first central bank in the Arab world to join the group, which promotes transparency and integrity in global FX markets.\n\nOluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.
