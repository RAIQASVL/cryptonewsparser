The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also charged Coinbase with violating federal securities laws for its staking product, but dropped that suit in February. Since the SEC’s retreat, state securities regulators in Kentucky, Vermont and South Carolina have also abandoned their own cases against the exchange.\n\nThe remaining states with staking-related suits against Coinbase include Alabama, California, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin. Spokespeople for California, Maryland, and Wisconsin declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nA representative for the New Jersey Bureau of Securities told CoinDesk the “Coinbase matter remains open,” and Bill Beatty, securities administrator for the Washington Department of Financial Institutions said the state’s “case with Coinbase remains ongoing at this time.”\n\nThe Alabama Securities Commission did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment.\n\nOn the news team at CoinDesk, Cheyenne focuses on crypto regulation and crime. Cheyenne is originally from Houston, Texas. She studied political science at Tulane University in Louisiana. In December 2021, she graduated from CUNY's Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, where she focused on business and economics reporting.
