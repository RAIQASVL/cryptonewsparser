Spokespeople for California, Maryland, and Wisconsin declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nA representative for the New Jersey Bureau of Securities told CoinDesk the “Coinbase matter remains open,” and Bill Beatty, securities administrator for the Washington Department of Financial Institutions said the state’s “case with Coinbase remains ongoing at this time.”\n\nThe Alabama Securities Commission did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment.\n\nOn the news team at CoinDesk, Cheyenne focuses on crypto regulation and crime.
