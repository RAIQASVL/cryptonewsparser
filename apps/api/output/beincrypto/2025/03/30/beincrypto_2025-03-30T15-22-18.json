    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Bitcoin remains below $90,000 with bearish indicators, yet rising whale accumulation signals growing institutional interest.\n• Ichimoku Cloud analysis shows resistance ahead, with bearish momentum dominant unless a decisive breakout occurs.\n• BTC may test $88,000 if buyers push past $85K resistance, but risks revisiting $79K support if momentum stalls.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been trading below the $90,000 mark since March 7, struggling to regain upward momentum amid shifting market sentiment.\n\nMeanwhile, technical indicators such as the Ichimoku Cloud and EMA lines suggest the trend remains bearish, though a potential reversal is not off the table.\n\nBitcoin Whales Just Hit Its Highest Level In More Than 3 Months\n\nThe number of Bitcoin whales—wallets holding at least 1,000 BTC—has been steadily increasing in recent weeks. On March 22, there were 1,980 such addresses, and that figure has since climbed to 1,991.\n\nWhile a change of 11 might seem modest at first glance, it represents a meaningful uptick in large-scale accumulation, especially considering this is the highest number of BTC whales recorded in over three months.\n\nTracking Bitcoin whales is critical because these large holders often have the power to influence price movements due to the sheer size of their positions. An increase in whale addresses can signal rising confidence among institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals.\n\nWhen more whales accumulate rather than distribute, it often suggests bullish sentiment and reduced selling pressure.\n\nWith the current whale count hitting a multi-month high, it could imply that significant players are positioning ahead of a potential upward move in Bitcoin’s price.\n\nBTC Ichimoku Cloud Shows Challenges Ahead\n\nThe Ichimoku Cloud chart for Bitcoin shows the price consolidating just below the Kijun-sen (red line) after a strong downward move.\n\nThe Tenkan-sen (blue line) remains below the Kijun-sen, indicating short-term bearish momentum. Price action is attempting to stabilize but has yet to show a decisive shift in trend.\n\nThe Lagging Span (green line) trails below both the price and the cloud, reinforcing a bearish outlook from a historical perspective.\n\nThe Kumo (cloud) ahead is bearish, with the Senkou Span A (green cloud boundary) positioned below the Senkou Span B (red cloud boundary), and the cloud itself projecting downward.\n\nThis suggests resistance overhead and limited bullish momentum unless price manages to break through the cloud decisively.\n\nThe thin structure of the current cloud, however, hints at possible vulnerability—if buyers step in with strength, there could be a window for a reversal.\n\nBut for now, the overall setup favors caution, as the prevailing trend remains bearish according to Ichimoku principles.\n\nCan Bitcoin Rise To Test $88,000 Soon?\n\nBitcoin’s EMA lines continue to indicate a downtrend, with short-term moving averages positioned below the longer-term ones. This alignment suggests bearish momentum remains dominant for now.\n\nHowever, if buyers can regain control and establish an uptrend, Bitcoin price may climb toward the next key resistance levels.\n\nThe first challenge would be the resistance near $85,124—if broken, this could open the path to $87,482 and potentially $88,839, assuming bullish momentum strengthens and sustains.\n\nOn the flip side, failure to build upward momentum would reinforce the current bearish structure.\n\nIn that case, Bitcoin could revisit the support level around $81,187.\n\nA breakdown below this point would further validate the downtrend, potentially dragging the price down to $79,955.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

This comes amid rising geopolitical risks, the ballooning US deficit, and uncertainty driving capital flight.\n\n“In a recent Bank of America survey, 58% of fund managers said gold performs best in a trade war. This compares to just 9% for 30-year Treasury Bonds and 3% for Bitcoin,” The Kobeissi Letter noted.\n\n“In a recent Bank of America survey, 58% of fund managers said gold performs best in a trade war. This compares to just 9% for 30-year Treasury Bonds and 3% for Bitcoin,” The Kobeissi Letter noted.\n\nFor years, Bitcoin advocates have championed it as a hedge against economic instability. Yet, in 2025’s volatile macro environment, Bitcoin struggles to earn institutional investors’ full trust.\n\nThe Bank of America survey reflects this status, with long-term US Treasury bonds and even the US dollar losing appeal as trade wars and fiscal dysfunction shake market confidence.\n\nThe US deficit crisis—now projected to exceed $1.8 trillion—has further eroded confidence in traditional safe havens like US Treasuries.\n\n“This is what happens when the global reserve currency no longer behaves as the global reserve currency,” a trader quipped in a post.\n\n“This is what happens when the global reserve currency no longer behaves as the global reserve currency,” a trader quipped in a post.\n\nHowever, instead of looking to Bitcoin as an alternative, institutions are overwhelmingly choosing gold, doubling physical gold purchases to record levels.\n\nBarriers To Bitcoin Institutional Adoption\n\nDespite its fixed supply and decentralization, Bitcoin’s short-term volatility remains a key barrier to institutional adoption as a true safe-haven asset.\n\nWhile some traders still view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, it lacks the immediate liquidity and risk-averse appeal that gold provides during crises.\n\nFurther, President Trump is expected to announce sweeping new tariffs on “Liberation Day.” Experts flag the event as a potential trigger for extreme market volatility.\n\n“April 2nd is similar to election night. It is the biggest event of the year by an order of magnitude. 10x more important than any FOMC, which is a lot. And anything can happen, “Alex Krüger predicted.\n\n“April 2nd is similar to election night. It is the biggest event of the year by an order of magnitude. 10x more important than any FOMC, which is a lot. And anything can happen, “Alex Krüger predicted.\n\nTrade tensions have historically driven capital into safe-haven assets. With this announcement looming, investors preemptively position themselves again, favoring gold over Bitcoin.\n\n“Gold’s no longer just a hedge against inflation; it’s being treated as the hedge against everything: geopolitical risk, de-globalization, fiscal dysfunction, and now, weaponized trade. When 58% of fund managers say gold is the top performer in a trade war, that’s not just sentiment that’s allocation flow. When even long bonds and the dollar take a back seat, it’s a signal: the old playbook is being rewritten. In a world of rising tariffs, FX tension, and twin deficits, gold might be the only politically neutral store of value left,” trader Billy AU observed.\n\n“Gold’s no longer just a hedge against inflation; it’s being treated as the hedge against everything: geopolitical risk, de-globalization, fiscal dysfunction, and now, weaponized trade.

In a world of rising tariffs, FX tension, and twin deficits, gold might be the only politically neutral store of value left,” trader Billy AU observed.\n\nDespite Bitcoin’s struggle to capture institutional safe-haven flows in 2025, its long-term narrative remains intact.\n\nSpecifically, the global reserve currency system is changing, US debt concerns are mounting, and monetary policies continue to shift. Despite all these, Bitcoin’s value proposition as a censorship-resistant, borderless asset is still relevant.\n\nHowever, in the short term, its volatility and lack of widespread institutional adoption as a crisis hedge mean gold is taking the lead.\n\nFor Bitcoin believers, the key question is not whether Bitcoin will one day challenge gold but how long institutions will adopt it as a flight-to-safety asset.\n\nUntil then, gold remains the undisputed king in times of economic turmoil. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC exchange-traded funds notwithstanding) fights to prove its place in the next financial paradigm shift.\n\n“The ETF demand was real, but some of it was purely for arbitrage…There was a genuine demand for owning BTC, just not as much as we were led to believe,” analyst Kyle Chassé said recently.\n\n“The ETF demand was real, but some of it was purely for arbitrage…There was a genuine demand for owning BTC, just not as much as we were led to believe,” analyst Kyle Chassé said recently.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• A whale's $27.53 million, 10x leveraged PEPE position on Hyperliquid teeters on liquidation, sparking fears of a market-wide sell-off.\n• The whale added $3.8 million, in margin to delay liquidation, but PEPE's meme coin volatility makes the bet increasingly unstable.\n• Similar leveraged trades on Ethereum also face pressure, highlighting growing risks in crypto markets amid persistent downturns.\n\nA crypto whale’s high-stakes, 10x leveraged PEPE position on Hyperliquid faces mounting risk. The whale’s leveraged PEPE bet remains precarious, risking liquidation amid market instability.\n\nWith added margin but persistent losses, any adverse price move could trigger cascading sell-offs and broader crypto turbulence.\n\nWhale Opens 10X Leverage on PEPE\n\nCrypto and DeFi analyst Ai revealed a notable gamble by a whale trader, placing a high-stakes bet on the PEPE meme coin. They opened a 10x leveraged long position worth $27.53 million on the Hyperliquid network.\n\nHowever, the trade quickly turned against them, with unrealized losses amounting to $3.238 million.\n\nThe whale, identified by the address 0x507…BeDb6 initiated the position on March 24 at an entry price of $0.00814 per 1,000 PEPE. As it stands, they are now at risk of liquidation should the price fall to $0.005219.\n\nTo prevent forced closure, they have added 3.818 million USDC in margin (approximately $3.8 million).\n\nThe precarious nature of the position raises concerns about the broader risks to PEPE’s market stability and the implications for leveraged trading on Hyperliquid.\n\nUsing 10X leverage dramatically amplifies potential gains and losses, making this a highly volatile bet. Even minor price fluctuations can lead to significant swings in the whale’s account balance.\n\nIf PEPE’s price continues to decline and reaches the liquidation threshold, Hyperliquid’s automated systems will forcibly close the position.\n\nThis could further drive down PEPE’s price. Such liquidations often lead to cascading sell-offs as other leveraged traders get caught in a feedback loop, exacerbating market volatility.\n\nMeanwhile, the whale’s decision to inject more margin suggests they are committed to defending their position. However, this also signals the pressure they are under to maintain solvency.\n\nWhat Are the Perceived Risks?\n\nPEPE’s inherent volatility adds another layer of risk. As a meme coin, its price movements are often driven by social sentiment rather than fundamental value. This makes it particularly vulnerable to quick price swings, which could trouble the whale’s position.\n\nIf negative market sentiment prevails due to external factors such as regulatory news or shifting trader interest, PEPE’s price could decline further.\n\nGiven that the market has already been experiencing a downturn, the likelihood of additional price pressure remains a significant concern.\n\nAnother critical issue is the potential for whale-induced market manipulation. Large-scale traders have the power to sway market trends, either through direct trades or by influencing sentiment.\n\nBy continuously adding margin to avoid liquidation, the whale may attempt to prop up PEPE’s price and prevent a major sell-off.\n\nHowever, such efforts can only go so far. If the whale ultimately exits their position, it could trigger panic among smaller traders, leading to a rapid decline in PEPE’s value.\n\nThe broader impact on retail investors closely tracking whale activity could exacerbate instability.\n\nThe risks associated with liquidation cascades also cannot be ignored. Hyperliquid’s decentralized liquidation mechanism allows efficient order processing.\n\nHowever, a large liquidation can spark a chain reaction in highly leveraged markets.\n\nThe PEPE price has fallen by over 5% in the last 24 hours and was trading for $0.00000721 as of this writing.\n\nIf PEPE’s price nears the whale’s liquidation point, other traders may begin preemptively selling to avoid losses, creating a snowball effect.\n\nThis could result in PEPE experiencing sharp price declines quickly, potentially affecting other meme coins and broader crypto markets.\n\nKOL Opens Similar Leverage Position for Ethereum\n\nThe risks are not limited to PEPE alone. A similar situation is unfolding with another prominent trader, CBB, a Key Opinion Leader (KOL) on X. They opened a 10X leveraged long position on Ethereum (ETH) worth $2.11 million.\n\nCurrently, they are facing an unrealized loss of $1.035 million due to an entry price of $2,730. Given current market conditions, this has proven to be too high.\n\nHowever, unlike the PEPE whale, this trader has a more comfortable margin buffer, with a liquidation price of $1,167.8.\n\nWhile not in immediate danger, this case further reflects the precarious nature of highly leveraged trading in volatile markets.\n\nThe unfolding drama surrounding these positions highlights the risks of excessive leverage, particularly in a declining market.\n\nWith PEPE’s whale struggling to maintain their position and Ethereum’s long traders facing mounting losses, the broader crypto market could see increased volatility in the coming days.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

The community has questioned Ethereum’s relevance in the shifting crypto industry, putting the altcoin’s future under intense scrutiny.\n\nMainstream narratives paint a dark picture of Ethereum’s developer exodus and underperformance.\n\nIs Ethereum Getting Left Behind?\n\nCritics reflect how Bitcoin’s ideological and political dominance, particularly after President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, overshadowed Ethereum’s early promise of a global, decentralized computer.\n\nEthereum’s price downturn — down 44% in 2025 — is being driven by the exodus of developers, and network activity dropping 17% last year.\n\nIn contrast, Solana has spiked with an 83% uptick in developer engagement, partly driven by its adoption of meme coins and fast transaction speeds.\n\nStandard Chartered analysts also cut their end-of-year Ether price forecast by 60%, based on what they told clients was Ethereum’s “identity crisis” and unclear direction forward.\n\nEthereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, acknowledged the growing criticism but rejected demands for quick fixes.\n\nHe reiterated Ethereum’s trajectory hinges on “long-term value” and real-world utility, not short-term speculation or political power.\n\n“The only thing that can move Ethereum forward at this point is things that give long term value in a way where you can clearly see that the value is coming from a thing that is actually sustainable — like actual use for people,” Bloomberg reported citing Buterin.\n\n“The only thing that can move Ethereum forward at this point is things that give long term value in a way where you can clearly see that the value is coming from a thing that is actually sustainable — like actual use for people,” Bloomberg reported citing Buterin.\n\nGrassroots Push: Ethereum’s Loyalists See Opportunity\n\nDespite growing critics, Ethereum’s most diehard supporters remain undeterred. They view the pessimism around the largest altcoin by market cap metrics as an inflection point for a turnaround.\n\n“This is a bottom signal. Mainstream media almost always get the timing wrong,” a user on X remarked.\n\n“This is a bottom signal. Mainstream media almost always get the timing wrong,” a user on X remarked.\n\nEthereum Layer-2 (L2) solutions continue to dominate chain activity, while real-world asset (RWA) growth on Ethereum looks “exponential,” the user added.\n\nOther users also reacted to the Bloomberg article, which renewed bullishness.\n\n“Was starting to feel bearish but this post has me all bulled up again,” one added in a post.\n\n“Was starting to feel bearish but this post has me all bulled up again,” one added in a post.\n\nThese responses, among others, speak to Ethereum’s strong community, which has tended to shine in the face of adversity and innovation.\n\nThere is no political spectacle for Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, with growth hinging on scalability and real-world use.\n\nRecently, Buterin outlined a roadmap to Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem, calling for funding of open-source development to guarantee continued progress.\n\nHis vision is already coming to fruition as projects like Celo successfully transition to Ethereum layer-2 solutions. As BeInCrypto reported, Celo completed the migration after 20 months of testing, which aimed to improve scalability and transaction efficiency.\n\nAdoption of Ethereum’s L2 scaling solutions, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, has also increased.\n\nThis aligns with Buterin’s perspective that sustainable blockchain growth comes from strengthened infrastructures, not hype-driven narratives.\n\nThese moves indicate that while speculation on Ethereum may be declining, long-term technological adoption could pick up the slack.\n\nCan the Pectra Upgrade Flip the Narrative?\n\nLikewise, Ethereum managed to overcome challenges through significant upgrades. Against that backdrop, its soon-to-be-released Pectra Upgrade could be revolutionary.\n\nThough delays have frustrated some in the community, the upgrade is anticipated to offer improved security, transaction efficiency, and developer-friendly tools.\n\nEthereum’s continued commitment to innovation and ongoing testnet trials may be the perfect catalyst for reclaiming its DeFi throne. The network’s dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT (non-fungible tokens) ecosystems proves particularly resilient.\n\nIndeed, meme coins and speculative trading have shifted to faster chains such as Solana.\n\nThat said, when it comes to high-value applications, Ethereum is still at the heart of it all — from decentralized exchanges (DEXs)  to institutional-grade financial products.\n\nThe question now, however, is whether Ethereum’s focus on real-world adoption can preserve and outlast Bitcoin’s dominance in the halls of political and financial attention.\n\nWith the Pectra upgrade on the horizon and a community loyal to the chain’s dominance in the ecosystem, Ethereum may soon show again that its greatest strength lies not in the hype but in resilience and innovation.\n\nDespite community optimism, Ethereum’s price is down by 2.22% in the last 24 hours. BeInCrypto data shows ETH was trading for $1,842 as of this writing.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

Meanwhile, the latter targeted virtual currency derivatives listings.\n\nUpon establishment, both directives hinted at the singling out of crypto products for tougher oversight.\n\nHowever, both have now been deemed unnecessary, effective immediately, amid the commodities’ regulator’s push toward regulatory consistency.\n\nThe decision indicates a shift to treating digital asset derivatives like those on Ethereum (ETH) as traditional finance (TradFi) products.\n\n“As stated in today’s withdrawal letter, DCR determined to withdraw the advisory to ensure that it does not suggest that its regulatory treatment of digital asset derivatives will vary from its treatment of other products,” the CFTC explained.\n\n“As stated in today’s withdrawal letter, DCR determined to withdraw the advisory to ensure that it does not suggest that its regulatory treatment of digital asset derivatives will vary from its treatment of other products,” the CFTC explained.\n\nThis move will eliminate the perceived distinctions between digital asset derivatives and TradFi instruments.\n\nIt also paves the way for enhanced market participation, which will facilitate broader involvement from financial institutions in the digital asset derivatives market. This could lead to increased liquidity and market maturity.\n\nNevertheless, the advisory warned derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) to prepare for risk assessments specific to digital products’ unique characteristics.\n\nTherefore, while it reflects the CFTC’s commitment to promoting innovation, it also suggests the intention to maintain strong financial oversight.\n\nMeanwhile, this decision comes only weeks after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed US banks to offer crypto and stablecoin services without prior approval.\n\nHowever, the OCC had articulated that despite lifting the approval requirement, banks must maintain strong risk management controls akin to those required for traditional banking operations.\n\n“The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones,” said Rodney E. Hood, the acting Comptroller of the Currency.\n\n“The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones,” said Rodney E.

On the one hand, the CFTC seeks to scrap the distinction between crypto derivatives and TradFi instruments.\n\nOn the other hand, the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) and OCC want banks to maintain risk management controls similar to those required for traditional banking operations despite providing crypto and stablecoin services.\n\nNotwithstanding, these efforts mirror a growing trend among US financial regulators to lower barriers and foster responsible innovation in the crypto industry.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• ONDO falls over 5% daily and 19% monthly, with bearish technicals and weak whale support signaling ongoing downside risk.\n• RSI rebounds from 27.5 to 34, showing slight momentum recovery, but still near oversold territory with fragile market sentiment.\n• Whale accumulation stalls as major holders reduce positions, raising concerns over ONDO’s ability to maintain key support levels.\n\nONDO is facing notable downside pressure. It has been down over 5% in the last 24 hours and corrected more than 19% over the past 30 days. With its market cap now sitting around $2.5 billion, the coin is way below competitors like Chainlink and Mantra in terms of market cap.\n\nRecent technical indicators and whale behavior suggest that the current weakness may not be over, despite a slight recovery in momentum.\n\nONDO RSI Is Recovering From Oversold Levels\n\nONDO’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 34 after rebounding slightly from an earlier dip to 27.5. Just two days ago, the RSI was at 54.39, indicating how quickly momentum has shifted.\n\nThe RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes. It ranges from 0 to 100.\n\nReadings below 30 are typically considered oversold, suggesting the asset may be undervalued and due for a bounce, while readings above 70 are viewed as overbought, indicating potential for a pullback.\n\nWith ONDO’s RSI now at 34, it has technically exited oversold territory but remains near the lower end of the scale. This suggests that while the sharpest selling pressure may have eased, the market is still fragile ,and sentiment remains cautious.\n\nIf the RSI continues to recover and climbs above 40 or 50, it could signal a shift toward more bullish momentum.\n\nHowever, if selling resumes and RSI falls back below 30, it would indicate renewed downside risk and potential for further price declines.\n\nWhales Recently Stopped Their Accumulation\n\nThe number of ONDO whales—addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million ONDO—fluctuated in late March, initially increasing from 188 to 195 between March 22 and March 26 before declining to 191 in recent days.\n\nThis whale activity pattern is significant as these large holders often influence market sentiment and price movements, with their accumulation or distribution phases potentially foreshadowing broader market trends.\n\nTracking whale addresses provides valuable insights into how influential investors are positioning themselves, which can help predict potential price action.\n\nThe failure of Whale addresses to maintain the breakout above 195 and the subsequent return to 191 could signal bearish sentiment among larger investors.\n\nThis retreat might indicate that whales are taking profits or reducing exposure, which could create downward price pressure on ONDO in the short term.\n\nWhen large holders begin to reduce their positions after a period of accumulation, it often precedes price corrections, suggesting that ONDO may experience resistance in maintaining upward momentum until whale confidence returns and accumulation resumes.\n\nWill ONDO Fall Below $0.70 For The First Time Since November?\n\nONDO’s Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines are currently aligned in a bearish formation, suggesting the ongoing downtrend may persist. If this weakness continues, ONDO could drop to test the key support level at $0.73.\n\nA break below that would be significant, potentially sending the price under $0.70 for the first time since November 2024.\n\nThe token has been struggling to keep pace with other Real World Asset (RWA) coins like Mantra, and this underperformance adds further pressure to ONDO’s short-term outlook.\n\nHowever, if sentiment shifts and ONDO manages to reverse its trend, the first key level to watch is the resistance at $0.82.\n\nA breakout above this level could trigger a broader recovery, with price targets at $0.90 and $0.95.\n\nIf the RWA sector as a whole regains momentum, ONDO could even rise above the $1 mark and aim for the next major resistance at $1.23.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• GRASS jumps nearly 30% in a week as ADX climbs to 30.31 and BBTrend stays positive, signaling a strong and sustained uptrend.\n• Momentum remains bullish with EMA lines nearing a golden cross, potentially confirming a breakout above the $1.85 resistance.\n• Slight BBTrend dip and cooling indicators suggest consolidation risk, with $1.63 as key support if momentum begins to fade.\n\nGRASS has surged nearly 30% over the past week, with its market cap climbing back to $415 million and its price breaking above $1.70 for the first time since March 10.\n\nThis strong performance has been backed by bullish technical signals, including a consistently positive BBTrend and a rising ADX. However, with momentum indicators beginning to cool slightly, the next few days will be key in determining whether GRASS continues its rally or enters a period of consolidation.\n\nGRASS BBTrend Remains Strong, But Is Slightly Declining\n\nGRASS’s BBTrend is currently at 11.28, marking the fourth consecutive day in positive territory, after peaking at 14.85 two days ago.\n\nThe BBTrend (Bollinger Band Trend) indicator measures the strength of price trends by analyzing how far the price moves away from its moving average within Bollinger Bands.\n\nGenerally, values above zero indicate an uptrend, while values below zero suggest a downtrend. The higher the positive reading, the stronger the bullish momentum, whereas deep negative values reflect strong selling pressure.\n\nWith GRASS maintaining a BBTrend of 11.28, the token is still in an active uptrend, although slightly cooler than its recent peak.\n\nSustained positive BBTrend readings typically signal that buyers remain in control and that upward momentum could continue.\n\nHowever, the slight pullback from 14.85 might suggest that momentum is starting to ease. If the BBTrend begins to decline further, it could be an early sign of consolidation or a possible reversal.\n\nFor now, GRASS appears to be holding onto bullish momentum, but traders should monitor any shifts in trend strength closely.\n\nGRASS ADX Shows The Uptrend Is Getting Stronger\n\nGRASS is currently in an uptrend, with its Average Directional Index (ADX) rising to 30.31 from 26.49 just a day ago, indicating a strengthening trend momentum.\n\nThe ADX is a widely used technical indicator that measures the strength of a trend, regardless of its direction, on a scale from 0 to 100.\n\nValues below 20 suggest a weak or non-existent trend, while readings above 25 indicate that a trend is gaining traction.\n\nWhen the ADX moves above 30, it typically signals that the trend is becoming well-established and may continue in the same direction.\n\nWith GRASS’s ADX now above the 30 threshold, the current uptrend appears to be gaining strength. This suggests that bullish momentum is firming up and that price action may continue favoring the upside in the near term.\n\nAs long as the ADX remains elevated or continues climbing, the trend is likely to sustain, attracting more interest from momentum traders.\n\nHowever, if the ADX begins to plateau or reverse, it could signal a potential slowdown or consolidation phase ahead.\n\nGRASS Could Form A New Golden Cross Soon\n\nGRASS’s Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines are showing signs of a potential golden cross, a bullish signal that occurs when a short-term EMA crosses above a long-term one.\n\nIf this crossover confirms, it could mark the beginning of a sustained uptrend. GRASS is likely to test the immediate resistance at $1.85 as some artificial intelligence coins start to recover good momentum.\n\nShould bullish momentum from the past week persist, the token may push even higher toward $2.26 and eventually $2.56 or $2.79, possibly solidifying its position as one of the best-performing altcoins in the market.\n\nHowever, if the trend fails to hold and sentiment shifts bearish, GRASS could pull back to retest the support at $1.63.\n\nA break below this level might open the door to a deeper correction, potentially driving the price down to $1.22.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Vitalik Buterin has introduced a new Ethereum roadmap focused on improving the security, finality, and scalability of Layer 2 solutions.\n• Buterin also proposes a shift from public goods funding to open-source funding to reduce social bias and better support impactful development.\n• Together, these initiatives aim to reinforce Ethereum’s decentralization while promoting more resilient infrastructure and funding practices.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced a new roadmap aimed at strengthening the security and finality of Layer 2 (L2) solutions.\n\nHis proposal introduces a flexible, multi-proof system designed to support Ethereum’s scalability while preserving its core principles of decentralization and trust minimization.\n\nEthereum’s New Layer 2 Roadmap\n\nAt the heart of Buterin’s technical framework is a “2-of-3” model. This system uses three different proof types—optimistic, zero-knowledge (ZK), and trusted execution environment (TEE) provers.\n\nA transaction is finalized when any two of these agree, significantly reducing the risk tied to relying on a single-proof method. The model offers a pragmatic balance between speed, robustness, and decentralization.\n\nButerin emphasized the importance of diversification, especially as zero-knowledge systems mature. He warned that shared code among ZK rollups could cause bugs to propagate across implementations, raising systemic risk.\n\n“This means that the finality of rollups can be as fast as zk proving (~<1hr for now) while protecting the system from soundness bugs in the zk system,” Wei Dai, a research partner at 1kxnetwork, explained.\n\n“This means that the finality of rollups can be as fast as zk proving (~<1hr for now) while protecting the system from soundness bugs in the zk system,” Wei Dai, a research partner at 1kxnetwork, explained.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin’s roadmap also lays out the requirements for what he calls “Stage 2 rollups.” These next-generation rollups would deliver near-instant confirmations, high finality, and strong resistance to failures—even in semi-trusted environments.\n\nImportantly, they would still adhere to Ethereum’s 30-day upgrade delay, a rule that safeguards the network’s stability during transitions.\n\nButerin Makes Case for Open-Source Funding\n\nBeyond scalability, Buterin is also advocating a cultural shift in how the crypto community approaches development funding.\n\nIn a separate blog post, he suggested shifting the focus from “public goods funding” to “open-source funding.”\n\nHis concern is that the phrase “public goods” has become politically and socially loaded, often used in ways that prioritize perception over impact.\n\n“A big part of the reason why the term ‘public good’ is vulnerable to social gaming is precisely the fact that the definition of ‘public good’ is stretched so easily,” Buterin argued\n\n“A big part of the reason why the term ‘public good’ is vulnerable to social gaming is precisely the fact that the definition of ‘public good’ is stretched so easily,” Buterin argued\n\nHe noted that public goods funding is vulnerable to social desirability bias. This often favors those who can navigate community politics over those who deliver meaningful value.\n\nIn contrast, open-source funding emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and the building of tools that genuinely benefit the broader ecosystem.\n\nButerin believes that the goal should not be to fund any open-source project indiscriminately but to support those that create maximum value for humanity.\n\nThis stance aligns with his broader vision of a sustainable, community-driven blockchain infrastructure.\n\nTogether, Buterin’s proposals could redefine both the technical direction of Ethereum’s scalability efforts and the philosophical foundations of its funding strategies—reinforcing the network’s long-term commitment to decentralization, security, and public benefit.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• XRP tumbles over 12% in a week as DMI shows ADX spiking to 47.14, confirming a powerful bearish trend with growing downside momentum.\n• Active addresses plunge over 70% from March highs, signaling collapsing user engagement and weakening on-chain fundamentals for XRP.\n• Bearish EMA alignment points to potential drop below $1.90, with $1.77 as the next major support if sentiment doesn't improve quickly.\n\nXRP is under heavy selling pressure, down more than 5% in the last 24 hours and over 12% in the past seven days. The recent downturn has been accompanied by increasingly bearish technical indicators, including a sharp spike in trend strength and a collapse in on-chain activity.\n\nWith price momentum weakening and user engagement dropping, concerns are mounting over XRP’s ability to hold key support levels. Unless sentiment shifts quickly, the path of least resistance appears to remain to the downside.\n\nDMI Chart Shows The Current Downtrend Is Very Strong\n\nXRP’s Directional Movement Index (DMI) is currently flashing strong bearish signals, with the Average Directional Index (ADX) surging to 47.14 from 25.43 just a day ago.\n\nThe ADX measures the strength of a trend, regardless of its direction, and values above 25 generally indicate that a trend is gaining momentum.\n\nA reading above 40—like XRP’s current level—suggests a very strong trend is in play. Given that XRP is currently in a downtrend, this rising ADX points to intensifying bearish momentum and a market leaning heavily toward further declines.\n\nDigging deeper into the DMI components, the +DI, which tracks upward price pressure, has dropped sharply from 20.13 to 5.76. Meanwhile, the -DI, which tracks downward price pressure, has surged from 8.97 to 33.77.\n\nThis stark divergence reinforces the bearish trend, indicating that sellers are aggressively taking control while buyer strength fades.\n\nWith ADX confirming the strength of this move and directional indicators tilting heavily to the downside, XRP’s price could remain under pressure in the short term unless a significant reversal in sentiment occurs.\n\nXRP Active Addresses Are Heavily Down\n\nXRP’s 7-day active addresses have seen a sharp decline over the past week, following a recent surge to new all-time highs. On March 19, the metric peaked at 1.22 million, signaling strong network activity and user engagement.\n\nHowever, since then, it has plummeted to just 331,000—a drop of over 70%. This sudden fall suggests that interest in transacting on the XRP has cooled off significantly in a short span of time.\n\nTracking active addresses is a key way to gauge on-chain activity and overall network health. A rising number of active addresses typically reflects growing user participation, increased demand, and potential investor interest—factors that can support price strength.\n\nConversely, a sharp decline like the one XRP is currently experiencing can point to weakening momentum and fading interest, which could put additional pressure on price.\n\nUnless user activity begins to rebound, this drop in network engagement may continue to weigh on XRP’s short-term outlook.\n\nXRP Could Drop Below $2 Soon\n\nXRP’s Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines are currently signaling a strong downtrend, with the short-term EMAs positioned below the longer-term ones—a classic bearish alignment.\n\nThis setup indicates that recent price momentum is weaker than the longer-term average, often seen during sustained corrections. If this downtrend continues, XRP could retest the support level at $1.90.\n\nA break below that could open the door to a deeper drop toward $1.77 in April.\n\nHowever, if market sentiment shifts and XRP price manages to reverse course, the first key level to watch is the resistance at $2.22.\n\nA successful breakout above this point could trigger renewed bullish momentum, potentially driving the price up to $2.47.\n\nIf that level also gets breached, XRP could push further to test the $2.59 mark.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.
