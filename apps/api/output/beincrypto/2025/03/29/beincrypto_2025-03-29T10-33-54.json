    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Pi Network remains under pressure with a 61% monthly loss and 12 straight days of negative BBTrend signaling strong bearish momentum.\n• RSI has bounced from oversold levels to 40.45 but still lingers below the neutral zone, showing weak buyer conviction.\n• EMAs confirm the ongoing downtrend, with support at $0.718 and resistance at $1.05 shaping PI’s near-term price outlook.\n\nPi Network (PI) has been under heavy selling pressure, with its price down more than 61% over the last 30 days. Despite a recent partnership with the Telegram Crypto Wallet, PI has struggled to regain momentum, as technical indicators remain mostly bearish.\n\nIts BBTrend has been negative for 12 consecutive days, and although the RSI has recovered slightly from oversold levels, it still sits below the neutral 50 mark. With the downtrend firmly intact and critical support levels approaching, PI’s next move will likely depend on whether buyers can step in and reverse the current trajectory.\n\nPI BBTrend Has Been Negative For 12 Days\n\nPi Network (PI) continues to face bearish pressure, as reflected in its BBTrend indicator, which remains deep in negative territory at -22.34.\n\nThis is despite recent headlines about the Telegram Crypto Wallet integrating Pi Network, news that has yet to translate into sustained upward momentum.\n\nThe BBTrend hit a recent low of -41 on March 21 and has stayed negative since March 16, marking twelve consecutive days of bearish trend signals. This prolonged weakness highlights the ongoing struggle for buyers to regain control of the market.\n\nBBTrend, or Bollinger Band Trend, is a momentum-based indicator that helps gauge the strength and direction of a trend. Positive BBTrend values indicate bullish momentum, while negative values point to bearish sentiment—the further from zero, the stronger the trend.\n\nWith PI’s BBTrend sitting at -22.34, the market remains firmly under bearish influence, even if the worst of the recent downtrend may be easing slightly from its extreme lows.\n\nUnless this trend flips back into positive territory soon, PI’s price could remain under pressure, with buyers staying cautious despite the recent integration news.\n\nPi Network RSI Has Recovered From Oversold But Still Lacks Bullish Momentum\n\nPi Network is showing early signs of recovery in momentum, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) rising to 40.45 after hitting 23.8 just two days ago.\n\nWhile this rebound suggests a reduction in overselling pressure, PI’s RSI hasn’t crossed above the neutral 50 mark in the past two weeks—highlighting ongoing weakness in bullish conviction.\n\nDespite the slight uptick, the market has yet to see enough strength to shift sentiment meaningfully in favor of buyers. This cautious climb could either lead to a breakout or stall into continued consolidation.\n\nThe RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 indicating overbought conditions and those below 30 suggesting the asset is oversold.\n\nWith PI’s RSI currently at 40.45, it’s in a neutral-to-bearish zone—no longer extremely oversold but still lacking strong buying pressure.\n\nFor a clearer trend reversal, the RSI would likely need to break above 50, which hasn’t happened in two weeks. Thus, the current move is more of a potential bottoming attempt rather than a confirmed shift.\n\nWill PI Continue Its Correction?\n\nPI price is currently trading within a well-established downtrend, as indicated by the alignment of its EMA (Exponential Moving Average) lines—where shorter-term EMAs remain firmly below longer-term ones.\n\nThis setup reflects persistent selling pressure, and if the correction continues, PI could revisit key support levels at $0.718, with a potential drop to $0.62 if that floor fails to hold.\n\nHowever, recent signs of life in the RSI hint that a short-term rebound might be brewing, offering some hope for a recovery.\n\nIf bullish momentum builds, PI could challenge resistance at $1.05 in the near term. A breakout above that level would shift sentiment and open the door for further gains, with $1.23 and even $1.79 as potential targets if the uptrend strengthens.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Cronos breaks above $0.10 after Trump Media and Crypto.com partnership, triggering a strong wave of bullish technical signals.\n• RSI cooled to 61.2 after peaking at 89.64, showing ongoing bullish momentum while allowing room for a sustainable rally.\n• BBTrend and EMA alignment confirm bullish momentum, with CRO eyeing resistance at $0.12, $0.149, and possibly $0.20.\n\nCronos (CRO) has been gaining serious momentum in recent weeks after Trump Media announced a partnership with Crypto.com. The news helped drive CRO’s price above the $0.10 mark for the first time since early February, triggering a wave of bullish technical signals.\n\nIndicators like RSI, BBTrend, and EMA alignment all point toward strong upward momentum, with CRO even becoming the top-performing altcoin in the past 24 hours. As traders eye key resistance and support levels, the question now is whether this rally has enough fuel to carry CRO toward $0.20.\n\nCRO RSI Is Back To Neutral After Reaching Its Highest Levels In Years\n\nCronos has captured market attention in recent weeks, especially following the announcement of a partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com.\n\nThis surge in interest drove CRO’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) to a peak of 89.64 just three days ago—its highest level in over a year—signaling intense buying pressure.\n\nSince then, the RSI has cooled down to 61.2, as the price consolidates after its strong rally. Despite the slight RSI drop, Cronos remains the top-performing altcoin in the past 24 hours, with a 7% price increase, showing that momentum is still in its favor.\n\nThe RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum indicator used to assess whether an asset is overbought or oversold. It ranges from 0 to 100, with levels above 70 typically suggesting overbought conditions, and levels below 30 indicating oversold territory.\n\nWith CRO’s RSI now at 61.2, the asset is no longer in an overbought state but still shows healthy bullish momentum. This suggests the price could continue climbing, especially if renewed interest or news catalysts emerge.\n\nAt the same time, the cooldown from extreme RSI levels may be giving the market room to build a more sustainable rally.\n\nCronos BBTrend Is Still Very Positive, But Down From The Recent Peak\n\nCronos has recently flipped its BBTrend indicator back into positive territory, currently sitting at 25.05—down slightly from a recent peak of 26.56 reached just yesterday.\n\nThis shift comes after five consecutive days of negative BBTrend values, suggesting a notable change in market momentum.\n\nThe move into positive territory indicates that bullish pressure has returned, aligning with the broader uptick in price and sentiment surrounding CRO following its recent surge in visibility and trading activity.\n\nBBTrend, or Bollinger Band Trend, is a momentum indicator that helps identify whether an asset is trending upwards, downwards, or moving sideways.\n\nA positive BBTrend value generally indicates bullish momentum, while a negative value points to bearish sentiment. The higher the value, the stronger the trend.\n\nWith CRO’s BBTrend at 25.05, the asset is showing strong bullish momentum, though the slight drop from yesterday’s peak could signal early signs of a cooldown or brief consolidation.\n\nHowever, as long as the BBTrend stays above zero, the upward bias remains intact, supporting the possibility of further CRO price appreciation.\n\nCan Cronos Rise 100% In The Next Weeks?\n\nCronos price recently climbed above the $0.10 mark for the first time since early February.\n\nThe EMA (Exponential Moving Average) indicators are painting a bullish picture, with short-term EMAs positioned above the long-term ones and maintaining a healthy distance between them—often a sign of strong upward momentum.\n\nIf this trend holds, CRO could target the next resistance levels at $0.12, followed by $0.149 and $0.166.\n\nIn the case of a particularly strong rally, a move toward $0.20 is on the table. This would mark its highest price since the end of 2024, as conversations about a potential CRO ETF could gain more traction soon.\n\nHowever, if bullish momentum starts to wane, CRO may pull back toward key support at $0.093. A break below that could accelerate the correction, with $0.082 and $0.068 as the next potential downside targets.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Judge Sandra Arroyo Salgado is investigating President Milei's connections and assets related to the LIBRA crypto scam.\n• Milei's sister, Karina, and political allies are also under scrutiny as part of the ongoing investigation.\n• Despite denying involvement, Milei's public image has suffered, with many Argentinians losing trust in him.\n\nInvestigations against Javier Milei are proceeding after his involvement in the LIBRA scandal. Judge Sandra Arroyo Salgado is examining his assets and whereabouts during the pump-and-dump incident.\n\nThis judge is also investigating similar topics regarding key political allies, especially his sister Karina. At present, it’s unclear if she will file criminal charges, but this scandal is not ideal for anyone’s political career.\n\nHow Much Was President Milei Involved With LIBRA?\n\nSince the LIBRA scandal rocked the meme coin market and Argentina’s political space last month, legal consequences have been falling on many of the perpetrators. Arrest warrants were issued for market maker Hayden Davis, and civil suits are active against its private backers.\n\nNow, prosecutors are also investigating President Javier Milei’s assets to determine his LIBRA involvement:\n\n“The LIBRA case would exemplify a crypto scam maneuver…a form of fraud. The promotion of this type of investment can undermine economic and financial systems over which the National Government is obligated to control and regulate their activities to prevent the movement of illicit and extra-systemic capital,” warned Judge Sandra Arroyo Salgado.\n\n“The LIBRA case would exemplify a crypto scam maneuver…a form of fraud. The promotion of this type of investment can undermine economic and financial systems over which the National Government is obligated to control and regulate their activities to prevent the movement of illicit and extra-systemic capital,” warned Judge Sandra Arroyo Salgado.\n\nSpecifically, Judge Arroyo Salgado is investigating Milei’s connections to LIBRA, looking at several avenues. She wishes to determine his entire itinerary during the period that he publicly promoted the token.\n\nAdditionally, she ordered an investigation into his assets alongside his sister and several other prominent political allies.\n\nThe LIBRA scandal was so massive that investigations against Milei began almost immediately. Several US enforcement agencies were informed that they could also pursue charges against him, but none rose to the opportunity.\n\nBy looking at his assets and whereabouts, Arroyo Salgado wishes to nail down definitive proof of his involvement.\n\nPresident Milei, for his part, immediately denied any direct connection to LIBRA, but a subsequent televised interview only damaged his reputation further. According to a recent poll, most Argentinians have lost trust in their President.\n\nRegardless of the odds of criminal proceedings, factors like this could impede his ability to pass legislation or enact policy.\n\nUltimately, it’s unclear what specific consequences Milei may face from the LIBRA debacle. He is a sitting head of state, and charging him with a criminal offense would be a dicey prospect in any circumstance.\n\nStill, investigations against him are intensifying. If he did engage in political corruption with the LIBRA backers, it would leave telltale clues.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• The FDIC rescinds 2022 rule, allowing banks to engage in crypto activities without prior approval, signaling a more crypto-friendly stance.\n• The CFTC removes outdated crypto guidelines, aligning crypto derivatives with traditional financial products, reflecting a shift toward industry equality.\n• Both the FDIC and CFTC aim to foster cooperation with crypto by removing old rules, suggesting future flexibility in regulatory approaches.\n\nThe FDIC and CFTC have both been working to change previous crypto guidelines. As federal regulators reconcile with the industry, they are removing old rules that specifically target crypto.\n\nThe former institution is removing the requirement that banks report crypto business, while the latter holds crypto to the same standards as other industries.\n\nFDIC and CFTC Change Crypto Policies\n\nThe FDIC is one of the top financial regulators in the US, and it’s turning over a new leaf. After being one of the principal architects of Operation Choke Point 2.0, it recently began declassifying documents and changing rules that allowed crypto debanking.\n\nToday, the agency is revoking a 2022 directive that impacted banks’ interactions with crypto:\n\n“With today’s action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years. I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards,” said FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill.\n\n“With today’s action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years. I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards,” said FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill.\n\nSpecifically, it rescinded a rule that mandated that all banks and institutions under its supervision notify the FDIC of any crypto involvement. The new guideline claims that banks “may engage in permissible crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval” without enacting any other policies.\n\nSince Gary Gensler left the SEC, all the top US financial regulators have been trying to rework their relationship with crypto. In an apparent coincidence, the CFTC made a very similar move to the FDIC by rescinding two crypto guidelines.\n\nBoth of these actions did not establish a new policy; they merely removed the old ones.\n\nEssentially, both of the CFTC’s rule changes are set to ensure that crypto-related derivatives are subject to the same requirements as non-crypto ones. This is somewhat surprising, considering that the industry has typically tried to insist that it necessitates specific regulations.\n\nHowever, this is largely beside the point. The FDIC and CFTC are both working to remove previous guidelines that opposed the crypto industry.\n\nThese institutions will undoubtedly be amenable to creating new ones in the spirit of cooperation. In the meantime, this olive branch can help build a lot of goodwill.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

Binance recently ended its first listing vote, with BROCCOLI and Tutorial surging.\n\nCritics argue that these incidents undermine trust in both DeFi and CEX platforms, as meme coins continue to dominate headlines while more stable crypto sectors struggle for attention.\n\nStill, some platforms like Pump.fun are pushing for innovation, introducing features like token burning and revenue sharing in an effort to steer meme coins toward a more sustainable future.\n\nThese concerns have only grown louder following the listing of speculative meme coins on Binance, including BNB Chain tokens like JELLY, which have added to the scrutiny.\n\nBinance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has addressed this criticism, stating that token listings should not dictate long-term price action.\n\nWhile listings can offer liquidity and improve market access, CZ emphasized that any price impact should be short-term. In the long run, token value should reflect real fundamentals—such as team commitment, development activity, and network performance.\n\nStill, even as the community pushes for more transparency, Binance Alpha has continued to list controversial tokens, including two Studio Ghibli-themed meme coins.\n\nHyperliquid Crisis Made Users Question Meme Coins\n\nMUBARAK’s drop was not the only crisis in the meme coin ecosystem this week. HYPE experienced a sharp decline following the JELLY short squeeze, triggering widespread speculation about the role of Hyperliquid and meme coins in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nSome users have even questioned if this could be the beginning of an FTX-style collapse as concerns grow over the unchecked volatility tied to meme coin derivatives.\n\nThe JELLY controversy has ignited debate around the fragility of emerging platforms and whether enough safeguards are in place to prevent systemic fallout from meme-driven market events. In response to the backlash, Hyperliquid announced it would strengthen its security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nJean Rausis, co-founder of the decentralized finance ecosystem SMARDEX, told BeInCrypto that the DeFi ecosystem needs to think about the image it sends to the market:\n\n“If we want DeFi to be adopted, the ecosystem needs to gain trust not only with its existing users but also in terms of the image it presents in the news. And it’s clear that with projects wrongly labelling themselves as “decentralized”, more incidents like this will happen.”\n\n“If we want DeFi to be adopted, the ecosystem needs to gain trust not only with its existing users but also in terms of the image it presents in the news. And it’s clear that with projects wrongly labelling themselves as “decentralized”, more incidents like this will happen.”\n\nSectors Like RWA Could Help To Grow Crypto Credibility\n\nKevin Rusher, founder of decentralized lending protocol RAAC, described the situation as a major blow to DeFi’s credibility. “This is another setback for DeFi adoption, but it’s not a surprise,” he said, noting that meme coins have reignited retail greed and diverted liquidity away from more sustainable sectors of the ecosystem.\n\nHe warned that tokens like TRUMP and MELANIA had captured too much mindshare during the last market surge, leaving DeFi vulnerable to speculative chaos.\n\nStill, Rusher pointed to the growing involvement of institutions like BlackRock as a sign of hope:\n\n“But it looks like institutions and big players like BlackRock also understand this need for stability in crypto, which is why they are now seriously focused on the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs). The unfortunate reality is that memecoins are likely here to stay, and they will be a real obstacle for DeFi growth in the short term. However, with RWAs bringing huge liquidity into the system from traditional finance, this sector will finally have the opportunity to grow without memecoin frenzies putting the whole ecosystem in danger.” – Rusher told BeInCrypto.\n\n“But it looks like institutions and big players like BlackRock also understand this need for stability in crypto, which is why they are now seriously focused on the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs).

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Crypto whales are accumulating OP, DOGE, and WLD, signaling potential rebounds despite recent price declines and weak sentiment.\n• Optimism saw an increase in large holders even after a 73% annual drop, hinting at quiet confidence from long-term investors.\n• DOGE and WLD whale wallets hit short-term highs, with meme coin and AI-token sentiment showing early signs of recovery.\n\nCrypto whales bought Optimism (OP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Worldcoin (WLD) in recent days. OP saw a rise in large holders despite being down 73% over the past year, while DOGE whale wallets climbed to a two-week high as meme coin sentiment shows signs of recovery.\n\nWLD also attracted accumulation, even after a 19% drop in the last 30 days, with whales adding to their positions over the last four days. This shift in on-chain behavior suggests that some big players may be preparing for a potential rebound across these assets.\n\nOptimism (OP)\n\nDespite Optimism experiencing a prolonged downtrend and a nearly 73% drop over the past year, on-chain data reveals a subtle but notable shift: the number of wallets holding at least 10,000 OP has increased from 4,303 to 4,313 in the last five days.\n\nThis uptick suggests that some larger investors may be accumulating OP at lower prices, potentially positioning for a long-term reversal.\n\nWhile OP has struggled to gain traction this cycle—remaining below the $2 mark since early January—this quiet accumulation could be an early sign of growing confidence among more seasoned holders.\n\nIf this accumulation translates into renewed bullish momentum, OP may attempt to reclaim key resistance levels, starting with $0.93.\n\nA successful breakout could lead to a push toward $1.06, and if buying pressure accelerates, $1.20 becomes a reasonable upside target.\n\nOn the flip side, if selling pressure remains dominant and no meaningful shift in momentum occurs, OP could continue its slide, with $0.74 acting as a key support level. A break below that could send the price below $0.70, reinforcing the downtrend and keeping investors cautious in the near term.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDogecoin, the largest meme coin by market cap, is seeing renewed interest from large holders. On-chain data reveals that crypto whales bought DOGE over the past week.\n\nSpecifically, the number of wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE rose from 740 to 747—the highest level in two weeks.\n\nThis suggests that big players may be positioning ahead of a potential rebound in the meme coin space, anticipating a shift in market sentiment. With DOGE historically responding strongly to meme coin hype, this uptick in whale activity could be a key early signal.\n\nIf momentum builds and meme coins stage a broader recovery, DOGE could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. A bullish breakout could send the price to test resistance around $0.19, and if that level is broken, further gains toward $0.22 and even $0.24 may follow.\n\nHowever, if the current market correction deepens, DOGE may retest support at $0.16, with a possible drop to $0.143 if selling pressure increases.\n\nFor now, whale accumulation offers a promising sign—but price direction will likely hinge on whether broader meme coin momentum returns.\n\nWorldcoin (WLD)\n\nWorldcoin, once one of the most hyped AI-related cryptocurrencies, has struggled to maintain its momentum in recent months, with its price falling nearly 19% over the past 30 days.\n\nDespite this decline, recent on-chain data shows that crypto whales have started accumulating WLD again. Over the last four days, the number of wallets holding between 10,000 and 1,000,000 WLD increased from 1,123 to 1,138.\n\nThis accumulation could signal growing confidence that WLD may soon find a bottom.\n\nIf buying momentum continues to build, WLD could attempt a short-term recovery. The first key resistance level is $0.91.\n\nA breakout above that could fuel a stronger rally toward $1.25, helping Worldcoin regain some of its lost ground.\n\nHowever, if bearish sentiment remains dominant, WLD may retest support at $0.80, and a break below that level could send it down further to $0.69.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

Unlike the case of Ross Ulbricht, there was no popular movement for these pardons, sparking community confusion.\n\nMeanwhile, Polymarket’s odds of FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried receiving a pardon also went up after this news. The crypto community is somewhat uneasy with the US president pardoning high-profile individuals who have pled guilty to evident wrongdoings.\n\nTrump Issues BitMEX Pardons\n\n​BitMEX, one of the most popular crypto exchanges, and its founders faced charges in the US for willfully violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Between 2015 and 2020, they failed to implement essential anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) programs.\n\nDespite publicly stating that BitMEX did not serve US customers, the founders were aware that the platform had significant user activity from the country.\n\nIn 2022, Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed each agreed to pay a $10 million criminal fine, representing gains derived from the offense. In January 2025, BitMEX itself pleaded guilty to violating the BSA and was fined $100 million.\n\nHowever, in a rather surprising move today, President Trump just pardoned all three co-founders.\n\nTrump did little to publicize these pardons, as neither he nor any of the recipients have yet made a public statement regarding the move. These men only faced fines, probation, and house arrest, and all were completely free at the time.\n\nArthur Hayes remains an influential commentator, but he has no further involvement with BitMEX.\n\nWill Trump Pardon Sam Bankman-Fried Next?\n\nTo call this move unexpected would be an understatement. Trump has given other crypto-related pardons, like with Ross Ulbricht, to be fair.\n\nHowever, Ulbricht’s case was a cause célèbre in the community. There were no corresponding vocal calls to issue BitMEX pardons, especially considering the founders’ light sentences.\n\nIn short, most of the crypto space’s reactions have been negative. At the time, even government crypto allies like “Crypto Mom” Hester Peirce supported the BitMEX arrests, and money laundering has never been popular in the space.\n\nThe crypto community is struggling to find a clear motivation for Trump’s pardons other than outright corruption.\n\n“My God, everything is for sale. I think he’ll pardon Sam Bankman-Fried,” said author Jacob Silverman.\n\n“My God, everything is for sale. I think he’ll pardon Sam Bankman-Fried,” said author Jacob Silverman.\n\nFor the last few months, FTX mastermind Sam Bankman-Fried and his family have been lobbying President Trump for a pardon. The community mostly considered this possibility a long shot, especially because Bankman-Fried directly opposed Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nSince the BitMEX pardons, Bankman-Fried’s Polymarket odds have shot up on Polymarket.\n\nThe crypto industry is in an unprecedented wave of scams, and some commentators worry that it could damage industry confidence. If Trump continues issuing pardons without a clear reason, it may embolden bad actors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Pi Network launched PiDaoSwap, a decentralized exchange to stabilize Pi Coin's value and counter price manipulation, while expanding into Telegram’s crypto wallet.\n• Trump Media partners with Crypto.com to launch ETFs, boosting the CRO token by nearly 20%, despite concerns over token manipulation practices.\n• Grayscale updated its investment list, adding new altcoins like Maple Finance and Geodnet, while removing others like Akash Network and Arweave.\n\nSeveral big stories and developments have occurred in the crypto space this week, including innovations in the Pi Network ecosystem, Grayscale updating its list of investible altcoins, and Donald Trump’s crypto play.\n\nIn case you missed these developments, among others, the following is a roundup of what happened in crypto this week.\n\nPi Network Introduces PiDaoSwap\n\nPi Network took a key step in decentralized finance (DeFi) this week, revealing the development of PiDaoSwap. This community-driven decentralized exchange (DEX) is designed to counter price manipulation.\n\nPiDaoSwap aims to stabilize Pi Coin’s value and enhance trust within its ecosystem by ensuring fair trading mechanisms.\n\n“Once completed, the Pi price will be reflected at its true value and will no longer be manipulated by current external exchanges,” Pi Network VietNames claimed.\n\n“Once completed, the Pi price will be reflected at its true value and will no longer be manipulated by current external exchanges,” Pi Network VietNames claimed.\n\nAnother positive development in the Pi Network ecosystem this week is the integration with Telegram’s crypto wallet. This move could provide access to up to one billion users and expand the controversial project’s mainstream adoption.\n\nWhile this move reflects Pi Network’s growing influence, questions around decentralization and exchange listings continue to loom large. Specifically, the Pi Network remains under scrutiny due to concerns about its centralization, particularly its SuperNodes.\n\nCritics argue that a heavily centralized network undermines the core principles of blockchain technology. Adding to the debate, analysts have pointed out that Pi Network’s absence from major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase stems from concerns over its operational transparency.\n\nTrump Media Partners with Crypto.com\n\nAnother hot headline this week in crypto was Trump Media’s announcement of a partnership with Crypto.com. The collaboration lays the groundwork for launching new ETFs (exchange-traded funds) based on Cronos, Bitcoin, and other assets.\n\nThe report inspired a nearly 20% surge in the Cronos (CRO) token, the powering token for the Crypto.com ecosystem. This collaboration added to the list of notable shifts as Trump’s media venture embraces cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, blockchain investigator ZachXBT raised concerns about Crypto.com’s token manipulation practices, souring sentiment for this partnership. Citing its re-issuance, the blockchain sleuth suggested the exchange may engage in opaque financial maneuvers.\n\nDespite these concerns, Crypto.com emerged unscathed as the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) concluded its investigation without filing any charges.\n\n“The SEC’s investigation into Crypto.com has been closed with no action being taken against Crypto.com. I continue to be proud of how this industry and its community have weathered storm after storm… The fact that we not only persevered but became stronger is a testament to our vision and the community supporting it,” wrote Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com.\n\n“The SEC’s investigation into Crypto.com has been closed with no action being taken against Crypto.com. I continue to be proud of how this industry and its community have weathered storm after storm… The fact that we not only persevered but became stronger is a testament to our vision and the community supporting it,” wrote Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com.\n\nThe announcement led to a notable jump in CRO’s price, reaffirming investor confidence in the exchange despite previous regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBeInCrypto data shows CRO was trading for $0.11 as of this writing, up by over 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nGameStop’s Bitcoin Announcement\n\nGameStop, the once-legendary meme stock, also made headlines this week in crypto. It announced an update to its investment policy, revealing that it had added Bitcoin as a Treasury Reserve Asset. In the immediate aftermath of this announcement, the company’s stock prices jumped 12% before profit booking set in.\n\nWhile this could have been a bullish catalyst, Bitcoin’s price remained largely unmoved. Analysts suggest the announcement lacked crucial details to trigger excitement and provoke a significant market reaction.\n\n“The announcement lacked key details —most importantly, how much Bitcoin they’re actually buying. While they’re sitting on about $4.8 billion in cash, we’ve seen no indication of what portion, if any, will be allocated to BTC,” Mati Greenspan, Founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, told BeInCrypto.\n\n“The announcement lacked key details —most importantly, how much Bitcoin they’re actually buying. While they’re sitting on about $4.8 billion in cash, we’ve seen no indication of what portion, if any, will be allocated to BTC,” Mati Greenspan, Founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, told BeInCrypto.\n\nFurther, the price impact for BTC was muted, given that Bitcoin payments are becoming more common among retailers.\n\nGrayscale Updates Investment List\n\nAdding to the list of what happened this week in crypto, Grayscale updated its list of investable altcoins for Q2 2025. The institutional crypto asset manager added three new tokens, Maple Finance (SYRUP), Geodnet (GEOD), and Story Protocol (IP), to its top 20 crypto investments.\n\n“…We believe the revised Top 20 list may offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for the coming quarter​‍‌‌‍‍​​​​​​​‌‍​‍​‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‌‍‍‌‌‍‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‍​‌‌‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌​‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍​‍​‍​​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‍‍​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌​‍​​‌​‌‍​​​‌​‌​​​​‍‌​‌​‍‌​‌‌​‌​‌‍‌‌​​‍​‍‌​‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌​​‍‌​‍‌​​​​‌​​‍​‍‌​‌‌‍​‌‌‍‌‍​‌​​​‌‍​‍​‌‌​‌​​​​​‌​​‌‍‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​​​​‌‍​‌‌‍​‍​‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‌​​‌​​​​‍‌‌‍‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​​​​‍‌‍‌‍​​‍​‌‍‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​​‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‌‌‌‌​‍‌‍​​‌‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​​‌​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌​‍​​‌​‌‍​​​‌​‌​​​​‍‌​‌​‍‌​‌‌​‌​‌‍‌‌​​‍​‍‌​‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌​​‍‌​‍‌​​​​‌​​‍​‍‌​‌‌‍​‌‌‍‌‍​‌​​​‌‍​‍​‌‌​‌​​​​​‌​​‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​​​​‌‍​‌‌‍​‍​‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‌​​‌​​​​‍‌‌‍‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​​​​‍‌‍‌‍​​‍​‌‍‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​​‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍‌‌‌​‍‌​‌​​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‍​,” the firm explained.\n\n“…We believe the revised Top 20 list may offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for the coming quarter​‍‌‌‍‍​​​​​​​‌‍​‍​‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‌‍‍‌‌‍‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‍​‌‌‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌​‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍​‍​‍​​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‍‍​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌​‍​​‌​‌‍​​​‌​‌​​​​‍‌​‌​‍‌​‌‌​‌​‌‍‌‌​​‍​‍‌​‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌​​‍‌​‍‌​​​​‌​​‍​‍‌​‌‌‍​‌‌‍‌‍​‌​​​‌‍​‍​‌‌​‌​​​​​‌​​‌‍‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​​​​‌‍​‌‌‍​‍​‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‌​​‌​​​​‍‌‌‍‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​​​​‍‌‍‌‍​​‍​‌‍‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​​‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‌‌‌‌​‍‌‍​​‌‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​​‌​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌​‍​​‌​‌‍​​​‌​‌​​​​‍‌​‌​‍‌​‌‌​‌​‌‍‌‌​​‍​‍‌​‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌​​‍‌​‍‌​​​​‌​​‍​‍‌​‌‌‍​‌‌‍‌‍​‌​​​‌‍​‍​‌‌​‌​​​​​‌​​‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​​​​‌‍​‌‌‍​‍​‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‌​​‌​​​​‍‌‌‍‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​​​​‍‌‍‌‍​​‍​‌‍‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​​‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍‌‌‌​‍‌​‌​​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‍​,” the firm explained.\n\nThis move reflects the company’s ongoing strategy to diversify its holdings and identify emerging digital assets with strong growth potential. At the same time, it truncated three altcoins from the same list- Akash Network (AKT), Arweave (AR), and Jupiter (JUP).\n\nBinance Embraces Studio Ghibli Meme Coins Frenzy\n\nElsewhere, a new meme coin craze emerged this week in crypto, drawing inspiration from the beloved Studio Ghibli brand. Binance Alpha responded to the trend by listing two Ghibli-themed tokens, Ghiblification and GhibliCZ.\n\nThese tokens have gained rapid traction as part of a broader wave of AI and pop culture-driven crypto speculation. The Ghibli meme coin phenomenon follows a pattern in previous meme-inspired tokens, where hype and social media engagement drive price action more than actual utility.\n\nWhile some traders see opportunities for quick gains, others caution against speculative bubbles that could lead to rapid market corrections. Nevertheless, Binance’s involvement reflects how major exchanges capitalize on trending narratives to attract trading volume.\n\nThis strategy, which continues to shape the DeFi space, has also drawn criticism as users challenge the listing standards of centralized exchanges (CEXs).\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• A $34.9 million scam brings total Coinbase user thefts this month to over $46 million, driven by social engineering tactics.\n• ZachXBT, a crypto investigator, claims Coinbase is not doing enough to prevent or warn users about these ongoing scams.\n• The exchange faces a growing fraud crisis, with losses possibly reaching $300 million annually, as social engineering continues to target users.\n\nAccording to ZachXBT, a Coinbase user lost $34.9 billion to scammers on Thursday, March 27. However, this is not an isolated trend, as Coinbase users have collectively lost more than $46 million to scams in March.\n\nScammers are targeting the exchange’s user base with a long track record of success. Coinbase customers should be on alert for social engineering attempts\n\nCoinbase Scams are Growing Out of Control\n\nDespite being one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Coinbase has been under scrutiny as its users are increasingly falling victim to scams. For over a year, sophisticated social engineering operations have been responsible for massive thefts.\n\nAccording to ZachXBT, these scammers are showing no signs of stopping:\n\n“It is suspected a Coinbase user was scammed yesterday for $34.9 million. After uncovering this theft, I noticed multiple other suspected thefts from Coinbase users in the past two weeks bringing the total stolen this month to $46 million+. Coinbase has not flagged any of the theft addresses from these victims in compliance tools,” he said via Telegram.\n\n“It is suspected a Coinbase user was scammed yesterday for $34.9 million.

Coinbase has not flagged any of the theft addresses from these victims in compliance tools,” he said via Telegram.\n\nZachXBT, a prominent crypto sleuth, has been persistently tracking scams against Coinbase users. Over the last few months, he’s identified several big crimes that relied on social engineering instead of outright hacks.\n\nFor example, last November, criminals posing as Coinbase Support managed to steal over $6.5 million.\n\nThis has reached the point where he claims that Coinbase is in a crisis of fraud and scams. Last month, ZachXBT estimated $150 million in annual losses, and he has now upgraded this to $300 million.\n\nHe hasn’t named any of his theories about the culprit or culprits. It could be an organized group, multiple independent actors, or other possibilities.\n\nHowever, the exchange’s response to these events has been rather underwhelming. ZachXBT claimed that Coinbase has been downright passive about these huge scams, failing to warn users or cooperate with investigators.\n\nIn a recent social media post, he accused Coinbase of apathy towards these incidents:\n\n“I have yet to see an incident where Coinbase flagged theft addresses. They are part of the problem, it shows they are not taking care of users,” he claimed.\n\n“I have yet to see an incident where Coinbase flagged theft addresses. They are part of the problem, it shows they are not taking care of users,” he claimed.\n\nOverall, given the increasing rate of these scams and the staggering amount of funds lost, Coinbase’s users should certainly be cautious about social engineering threats.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• HBAR struggles to breach the $0.200 resistance, with increased volatility suggesting a potential short-term breakout.\n• The tightening of Bollinger Bands points to rising volatility, potentially triggering a brief price surge for HBAR.\n• Weakening correlation with Bitcoin could limit HBAR's ability to maintain upward momentum, risking a drop below key support levels.\n\nHBAR recently failed to breach the key $0.200 resistance level, leading to increased volatility. Despite this setback, the altcoin may experience a short burst of bullishness in the near future.\n\nWhile challenges persist, the market may see a brief price surge before further fluctuations take place.\n\nHBAR Is Facing Mixed Signals\n\nThe correlation between HBAR and Bitcoin has dropped to 0.8, inching closer to falling into the negative zone. This indicates that HBAR is beginning to decouple from Bitcoin’s movements. If the correlation continues to weaken, HBAR may struggle to benefit from Bitcoin’s recent stabilization above $85,000, as seen in the broader market.\n\nThe decline in correlation suggests a shift in market conditions for HBAR. If it no longer follows Bitcoin’s price actions as closely, the altcoin could face additional challenges. With Bitcoin stabilizing, HBAR could find itself in a more isolated market position, hindering its ability to rally alongside Bitcoin.\n\nLooking at HBAR’s macro momentum, technical indicators like the Bollinger Bands show signs of a tightening squeeze. This squeeze is often a precursor to a major volatility spike, which is expected to hit HBAR soon. Historically, when the candlestick closes below the basis line during such squeezes, a sharp price surge follows.\n\nAs the Bollinger Bands tighten, volatility for HBAR is likely to increase. The squeeze typically leads to a breakout, and in HBAR’s case, a brief surge in price is expected. However, this spike may be short-lived, with the potential for HBAR to experience further challenges after the initial burst of movement.\n\nCan HBAR Price Finally Breach The Key Resistance?\n\nCurrently trading at $0.183, HBAR is struggling to breach the $0.200 resistance. However, the altcoin could be on track to break this barrier in the short term. The current market dynamics suggest that a brief surge past $0.20 is likely, offering a potential opportunity for traders.\n\nGiven the market factors, HBAR could see a short-term price spike before eventually falling back again. This pattern has been evident since mid-January, and it is expected to repeat. As a result, HBAR could push past the $0.200 resistance and reach $0.222 or $0.250 in the near future.\n\nHowever, if the declining correlation with Bitcoin continues to weigh on HBAR’s price, the altcoin may struggle to hold above key support levels. A failure to sustain momentum could result in HBAR falling below the $0.177 support, potentially dipping to $0.165. This would invalidate the bullish outlook and reinforce the ongoing bearish trend for the altcoin.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.
