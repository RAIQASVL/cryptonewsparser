    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Gate (GT) is 10% away from its all-time high, needing to breach $23.94 for further gains towards a new ATH.\n• BNB is holding above key support but must break $741 to challenge its ATH of $793; failure could lead to declines.\n• MANTRA (OM) requires a 40% rise to reach its ATH of $9.17; key resistance at $7.02 must be breached to maintain bullish momentum.\n• Cheems (CHEEMS) recently hit a new ATH and needs a 25% rally to set a new high, but support at $0.000001660 is critical for continued growth.\n\nMarch proved to be a challenging month for many altcoins, with several experiencing sharp corrections. However, as Q2 2025 approaches, some tokens are positioned to benefit from potential improvements in market conditions.\n\nBeInCrypto has analyzed four altcoins that, while not on the verge, are closer than others to reaching new all-time highs.\n\nGate (GT)\n\nGT is currently trading at $23.50, just 10% away from its all-time high of $25.96. To reach this level, the altcoin needs to breach and flip $23.94 into a support level. A successful break above this resistance could pave the way for further price gains.\n\nMarket conditions suggest that GT could experience a price increase in the coming days, provided investors refrain from selling at the sight of profits. If this occurs, GT could push past $25.96 and potentially form a new ATH.\n\nHowever, $23.94 has acted as a strong resistance for the past two months. If GT fails to breach this level, it could fall back to $22.56 or even lower to $21.25. Such a drop would invalidate the bullish outlook and potentially extend the current downtrend.\n\nBNB\n\nBNB has made several attempts to reach its all-time high of $793 since December 2024 but has consistently failed to break the $741 resistance. Despite sharp declines, the altcoin has shown resilience, bouncing back each time, indicating some level of investor confidence and market interest in its future performance.\n\nCurrently, BNB is holding above the critical support block between $587 and $619, standing about 25% away from its ATH. If broader market conditions turn bullish, BNB could be poised to attempt a new ATH within the next month.\n\nWhile BNB may face challenges at the $741 resistance level, strong support could push it through this barrier. However, if BNB fails to break $647 first, it could see a decline below the $619 support level. This would invalidate the bullish outlook and potentially extend the current downward trend.\n\nMANTRA (OM)\n\nOM’s price is currently trading at $6.58, still far from its all-time high of $9.17, requiring a 40% rise to reach that level. Despite this, the altcoin has significant potential to rally. A positive shift in market sentiment could drive it toward higher price levels.\n\nStrong bullish momentum has fueled OM’s rise, with the altcoin reaching an ATH of $9.17 towards the end of February. The continued inflow into OM signals the possibility of another rally. If OM successfully breaches $7.02 and flips $7.74 into support, it would solidify the bullish outlook.\n\nHowever, if OM fails to breach the $7.02 resistance, the altcoin could fall back to $6.17. This drop would likely continue its consolidation phase, as seen earlier this month, and invalidate the bullish thesis. A failure to break key resistance levels would limit price growth.\n\nCheems (CHEEMS)\n\nCHEEMS, though a lesser-known coin, has been gaining bullish momentum this month. Earlier this week, the altcoin formed a new all-time high at $0.000002179. This recent price surge indicates growing investor interest and the potential for further gains if market conditions remain favorable.\n\nFor CHEEMS to form a new ATH beyond $0.000002200, it will need a 25% rally from its current price. The altcoin is likely to bounce off the $0.000001660 support level, which could help capitalize on the current bullish momentum. A sustained move above this level could signal further upside potential.\n\nHowever, if CHEEMS fails to hold above the $0.000001660 support, it could face significant downward pressure. A drop below this level could result in CHEEMS falling to $0.000001461 or even as low as $0.000001132. Such a decline would invalidate the bullish outlook and may extend the downtrend.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• XRP's price fails to breach $2.56 resistance, while its circulation hits a 5-year low, signaling weak investor activity.\n• XRP's Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) drops to a four-month low, indicating lack of buying pressure and continued bearish momentum.v\n• If XRP can break and flip $2.56 into support, it could target $3.00; otherwise, it may face a drop to $2.27 or lower.\n\nXRP has been struggling to make any significant upward movement, with its price failing to breach a crucial resistance level. Despite attempts at recovery, the altcoin remains stuck, with no sustainable progress beyond the $2.56 barrier.\n\nThe drastic drop in circulation is worsening the situation, signaling a lack of investor activity and growing market concern.\n\nXRP Loses Interest\n\nThe circulation of XRP has seen a sharp decline, with its velocity falling to a five-year low. This metric, which tracks the rate at which XRP is transacted, has not been this low since January 2020. A drop in circulation often reflects investor hesitation, as less movement indicates a lack of confidence in the market.\n\nThis low velocity is a negative sign for XRP, suggesting that holders are not actively moving their assets. It points to a sense of bearishness in the market, as investors are reluctant to trade or engage with the asset. The absence of significant transaction activity further indicates that XRP may struggle to break out of its current rut without a shift in sentiment.\n\nXRP’s macro momentum is not showing signs of strength, with technical indicators reflecting the overall market sentiment. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) for XRP has dropped to a four-month low, remaining below the zero line and signaling bearishness. This suggests that investors are unwilling to invest more money in XRP due to the current market conditions.\n\nThe CMF being in the negative zone indicates that buying pressure is lacking and that holders are not injecting capital into the asset. This weak investor confidence could continue to hinder XRP’s potential for a rebound, making it more challenging to regain upward momentum in the near future.\n\nCam XRP Price Bounce Back?\n\nXRP’s price is currently at $2.36, and it is unable to break through the critical $2.56 resistance level. This resistance has been a significant barrier for the altcoin in the past, and it continues to act as a strong point of contention. Until XRP can successfully breach this level, the altcoin is unlikely to sustain any meaningful rally.\n\nGiven the current market conditions and declining circulation, XRP is not expected to breach the $2.56 resistance anytime soon. Instead, it could face a drop toward $2.27 or potentially lower to $2.14. This could extend the consolidation phase, erasing some of the recent gains made by the altcoin.\n\nThe only way to invalidate this bearish outlook is for XRP to break through and flip the $2.56 resistance into support. If successful, XRP could rise towards $3.00, recovering some of the losses from earlier in the year. However, this would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and broader market conditions to support such a move.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

This carefully structured public sale will introduce the KILO token to the market.\n\n“Binance Wallet is excited to host the exclusive Token Generation Event on BNB Smart Chain for KiloEx, the next generation user-friendly perpetual DEX, with PancakeSwap,” Binance wrote.\n\n“Binance Wallet is excited to host the exclusive Token Generation Event on BNB Smart Chain for KiloEx, the next generation user-friendly perpetual DEX, with PancakeSwap,” Binance wrote.\n\nKiloEx, a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) specializing in perpetual contracts, aims to enhance accessibility and liquidity in the crypto space. Through this collaboration, Binance Wallet will facilitate the exclusive launch of KILO tokens. Meanwhile, PancakeSwap DEX will provide additional trading support immediately after the event.\n\nThis partnership is designed to streamline token launches and offer a more user-friendly experience for investors looking to participate in early-stage projects. Data on GeckoTerminal shows that the KILO price is up by almost 2,300% on this news.\n\nWith a total raise of $750,000 in BNB and an initial allocation of 50 million tokens—representing 5% of the total supply—investors can participate in the event with a cap of 3 BNB per Binance Wallet user.\n\nUnlike traditional fundraising models, this event will allocate tokens pro rata, ensuring fair distribution among participants. Additionally, there is no vesting period. This means users can immediately trade their KILO tokens on Binance Wallet DEX or PancakeSwap as soon as the event concludes.\n\nKiloEX Shares KILO Tokenomics\n\nBeyond the TGE, KiloEx has unveiled a comprehensive tokenomics model for KILO. Shared on X (Twitter), the platform emphasized community engagement and long-term sustainability.\n\nWith a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, 10% is earmarked for airdrops, while 27% will support the broader ecosystem. The exclusive public sale on Binance Wallet accounts for 5%. Additional allocations are also made for staking rewards, strategic investments, and liquidity provisions.\n\nOne of the key highlights is the ability to convert KILO into xKILO. This provision allows holders to stake their tokens and earn a share of 30% of the platform’s revenue. Additionally, KILO holders will play an active role in the protocol’s governance, ensuring a decentralized decision-making process.\n\n“The key utilities of KILO include: Converting to xKILO for staking to earn 30% of the platform revenue. Future on-chain governance participation, enabling holders to help shape the project’s future,” KiloEx stated.\n\n“The key utilities of KILO include: Converting to xKILO for staking to earn 30% of the platform revenue.

Instead of exclusively listing new tokens on its centralized exchange, Binance has been leveraging Binance Wallet to facilitate token launches on decentralized platforms.\n\n“Binance has pivoted away from doing huge initial launches with big Day-1 selling pressure while doing more secondary listing shortly after running TGE campaign on Binance Wallet,” a user on X observed.\n\n“Binance has pivoted away from doing huge initial launches with big Day-1 selling pressure while doing more secondary listing shortly after running TGE campaign on Binance Wallet,” a user on X observed.\n\nThis move decentralizes the listing process and grants early adopters greater access. It also mitigates some of the challenges associated with centralized exchange listings. The collaboration with PancakeSwap reinforces this trend, positioning Binance Wallet as a pivotal player in the growth of decentralized token generation events.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• A recent survey reveals that 57.6% of Argentines don't trust President Javier Milei, following the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal.\n• The scandal, which led to millions in investor losses, triggered a sharp decline in Milei’s public image and trust.\n• Despite the fallout, Milei's La Libertad Avanza party remains ahead in election polls, securing 36.7% support.\n\nA recent survey has revealed a sharp decline in public confidence in Argentina’s president Javier Milei. 57.6% of respondents now express distrust in the libertarian leader.\n\nThis comes following his involvement in the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, which caused millions in investor losses.\n\nPublic Trust in Argentine President Javier Milei Plummets\n\nZuban Córdoba conducted the survey between March 12 and 14. It included responses from 1,600 respondents, with a confidence level of 95% and a 2.4% margin of error. The findings indicated a growing disillusionment with the government, and negative perceptions appeared to deepen each month.\n\n“The negativity is growing slowly but steadily, with no apparent ceiling. The change in tone and evaluation of the government is consolidating as more problematic issues emerge on the political agenda. One bloodbath after another could be the theme of the last few months,” the report read.\n\n“The negativity is growing slowly but steadily, with no apparent ceiling. The change in tone and evaluation of the government is consolidating as more problematic issues emerge on the political agenda. One bloodbath after another could be the theme of the last few months,” the report read.\n\nWhen asked, “More than a month since the crypto scam scandal broke out, how much do you trust Milei today?” only 36% expressed trust in the president, while 6.4% remained undecided.\n\nThe results marked a significant blow to Milei’s credibility. His overall image has also suffered, with 58.5% of respondents holding a negative perception of him. In comparison, 41.1% retain a favorable opinion.\n\nPublic approval of his administration mirrored this sentiment, with 58.4% disapproving of his management while 41.6% continuing to support him.\n\nFor context, the LIBRA scandal erupted on February 14 when Milei promoted the newly launched cryptocurrency in a now-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter). Within hours, the token’s value soared to a market capitalization of over $4 billion, only to crash by more than 95% as early investors, including alleged insiders, cashed out.\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Nansen reported that insiders and bots earned $180 million in profits. Meanwhile, 86% of LIBRA investors suffered losses of $251 million. The fallout left thousands of investors, many of them Milei’s own supporters, reeling from financial devastation.\n\nMilei swiftly distanced himself from the project, claiming that he merely spread the word about LIBRA and did not intend to endorse it. However, his explanation did little to quell public outrage or legal scrutiny.\n\nIn fact, many criminal complaints were filed against Milei and associated parties in the aftermath of the event. Argentine authorities also launched a federal investigation into the president’s involvement.\n\nDespite the damage to his reputation, Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party continues to lead in election polls ahead of the October 26 vote. The party has secured 36.7% support, compared to 32.5% for the opposition coalition Unión por la Patria. This shows that while the scandal has hurt Milei’s image, it has not completely dismantled his political movement.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Solana’s recent breakout from a falling wedge pattern signals the potential for a bullish reversal, with a 10% gain since March 19.\n• Open interest in Solana futures has increased by 22%, indicating strong demand and market participation, reinforcing the rally.\n• Aroon Up Line at 85.71% suggests strong bullish momentum, with a potential price target of $230.22 if the uptrend continues.\n\nSolana faced intense selling pressure after reaching a new all-time high of $295.83 on January 19. This caused its price to trend within a falling wedge pattern as bears took control.\n\nHowever, the recent market recovery has fueled a breakout above the upper trendline of this pattern, signaling a potential bullish reversal. Is SOL primed for a sustained rally?\n\nSOL’s Price Surge Signals Weakened Selling Pressure\n\nA falling wedge pattern emerges when an asset’s price moves within a narrowing downward-sloping range, characterized by lower highs and lower lows. While the price trends downward within the wedge, the narrowing range indicates weakening selling pressure, often leading to an upward breakout.\n\nSOL completed its breakout on March 19 and has since climbed by 10%. When an asset breaks above a falling wedge pattern like this, selling pressure has weakened, and buyers are gaining control.\n\nThis breakout is often accompanied by increased trading volume, confirming the possibility of a sustained uptrend. This is the case for SOL, as its rising open interest highlights the strong demand for the altcoin. It stands at $4.81 billion at press time, rallying 22% since the coin’s breakout.\n\nOpen interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. As with SOL, when open interest rises during a price rally, it signals increasing market participation and strong conviction among traders, reinforcing the momentum behind the uptrend.\n\nMoreover, SOL’s Aroon Up Line confirms the strength of its current rally. At 85.71% at press time, the indicator signals a strong bullish presence in the altcoin’s market.\n\nThe Aroon Indicator measures the strength and direction of a trend by tracking the time since the highest and lowest prices occurred. When an asset’s Aroon Up line is close to 100%, it signals a strong uptrend, indicating that it has recently hit new highs and has bullish momentum.\n\nSolana’s Breakout Could Push Price to $230, But Risks Remain\n\nTypically, when an asset breaks out of a falling wedge pattern, its price is expected to rise by an amount equal to the maximum height of the wedge. If this happens, SOL’s price could climb 67% to exchange hands at $230.22.\n\nOn the other hand, if selloffs resume, this bullish projection would be invalidated. SOL’s price could fall toward $112 if this happens.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

Specifically, Upbit’s parent company argued that the penalties were excessive.\n\nBased on this, the 5th Administrative Division of the Seoul Administrative Court, led by Judge Soonyeol Kim, ruled in favor of Dunamu, granting an emergency suspension of the business restriction.\n\n“…the effect will be suspended until 30 days from the date of the judgment of the main lawsuit. This is a measure to buy some time for Dunamu,” read the report.\n\n“…the effect will be suspended until 30 days from the date of the judgment of the main lawsuit. This is a measure to buy some time for Dunamu,” read the report.\n\nThe FIU’s initial penalty was based on allegations that Upbit violated South Korea’s Special Financial Transactions Act. The exchange reportedly allowed transactions with unregistered overseas exchanges without real-name verification.\n\nAuthorities discovered these infractions during an anti-money laundering (AML) audit from August to October last year.\n\n“…We deeply sympathize with the purpose of the financial authorities’ recent sanctions, which are aimed at stably establishing the anti-money laundering system and strengthening the legal compliance system through strict discipline on virtual asset operators,” Upbit responded at the time.\n\n“…We deeply sympathize with the purpose of the financial authorities’ recent sanctions, which are aimed at stably establishing the anti-money laundering system and strengthening the legal compliance system through strict discipline on virtual asset operators,” Upbit responded at the time.\n\nNevertheless, the FIU suspended Upbit’s ability to process deposits and withdrawals for new users for three months. Authorities reprimanded Upbit’s CEO, Lee Seok-woo, leading to the dismissal of the company’s compliance officer.\n\nDunamu quickly responded by filing a lawsuit to overturn the restriction and requesting a stay of execution. While the suspension was initially set to take effect on March 7, the court granted a temporary delay to review the case.\n\nWith the official suspension in place, Upbit can continue operations as usual until the final ruling.\n\nThis is not the first time Upbit has faced regulatory challenges. Just two months ago, South Korean authorities temporarily suspended the exchange over 700,000 Know-Your-Customer (KYC) violations.\n\nUpbit was also under investigation for alleged antitrust violations six months earlier, with authorities scrutinizing its market practices.\n\nWhile this ruling offers Upbit some breathing room, the legal battle is far from over. The final verdict in the main lawsuit will determine whether the FIU’s sanctions were justified or an overreach.\n\nThis ruling is pivotal for Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange. The South Korean government recently ordered Google to block 17 foreign cryptocurrency exchanges that failed to comply with local regulations. With these competitors effectively shut out, Upbit is in a prime position to strengthen its market presence and attract more users.\n\nIn a separate development, Upbit announced the launch of Wallace (WAL) trading pairs, citing the Korean won (KRW), Bitcoin (BTC), and USDT stablecoin.\n\nWAL token ties to the Walrus protocol, which focuses on decentralized storage for blockchain data. Walrus, developed by the Sui (SUI) team at Mysten Labs, recently secured $140 million in funding, with its mainnet launch coinciding with Upbit’s announcement on March 27.\n\nSouth Korea’s crypto market is influential, and Upbit’s listing could boost WAL’s visibility. However, past listings like ORCA and BONK show such gains often fade quickly.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Pump.fun is experimenting with revenue-sharing to encourage higher-quality token creation.\n• Token-burning and low, clear fees aim to minimize scams and improve ecosystem trust.\n• Despite a 56.8% drop in meme coin value, Pump.fun sees innovation as key to long-term industry growth.\n\nRecently, Pump.fun Co-founder Alon Cohen shared insights with followers about various aspects of the token-launching platform.\n\nKey highlights from Alon’s conversation with Bankless include the platform’s 4Chan-inspired design and communication style, its token-burning mechanism, and its revenue-sharing policy for creators.\n\nThe Next Chapter for Pump.fun\n\nPump.fun is a platform that enables users to easily create and launch new tokens, primarily meme coins, at low costs and high speeds. Dune data showed that Pump.fun has generated over 8.8 million tokens, accounting for more than 61% of all tokens issued on Solana.\n\nAmid a 95% drop in platform revenue, Alon revealed in a conversation with Bankless that Pump.fun is experimenting with a revenue-sharing mechanism for token creators. Some transaction fees will be returned to token creators, encouraging them to build higher-quality projects.\n\nThis initiative aims to attract more users and enhance the ecosystem’s sustainability. Pump.fun peaked in 2025 with a record daily revenue of $14 million. Moreover, the platform uses a “bonding curve” model, which helped it achieve an impressive $600 million in revenue.\n\n“At Pump.fun, we’ve implemented a bonding curve model. You know, that mechanism where token prices increase as more people buy in. And it’s been a game-changer, driving us to an incredible $600 million in revenue since we started.” said Alon\n\n“At Pump.fun, we’ve implemented a bonding curve model. You know, that mechanism where token prices increase as more people buy in. And it’s been a game-changer, driving us to an incredible $600 million in revenue since we started.” said Alon\n\nAlon also stated that Pump.fun has introduced mechanisms to minimize meme coins’ “extractive” nature. It will increase transparency and attract more users. These include a token-burning mechanism and adopting low, transparent fees to prevent scam projects (rug pulls).\n\nAt the same time, Pump.fun embraces a 4Chan-inspired design and communication style—a forum widely known for its meme culture. This approach has helped the platform attract many young users passionate about meme coins. Alon emphasized that Pump.fun’s success comes from meeting the community’s needs: a simple, user-friendly, and entertaining platform.\n\nThe launch of PumpSwap has sparked speculation about a potential shift in Pump.fun’s business model, suggesting competition with Raydium. However, Alon clarified that Pump.fun focuses on token creation and community-building, whereas Raydium specializes in trading and liquidity.\n\n“PumpSwap is a crucial step that will help grow the ecosystem through a more accessible, rewarding, and sustainable mechanism.” said Alon.\n\n“PumpSwap is a crucial step that will help grow the ecosystem through a more accessible, rewarding, and sustainable mechanism.” said Alon.\n\nWhile PumpSwap allows Pump.fun to compete directly with Raydium, Alon stressed that the primary goal is to make token creation easier for users.\n\nThe meme coin market is in decline, with market capitalization dropping 49% from its peak of $125 billion in December 2024. In early March, it even fell to just $54 billion. This signals the possible end of the “supercycle” of explosive growth.\n\nAlon predicts that meme coins will continue to exist and evolve despite the downturn. However, the industry needs innovations to reduce speculation and increase real-world value:\n\n“Meme coin projects can integrate additional features, such as NFTs or games, to create long-term value. Pump.fun will continue to support creativity in this space while also encouraging more meaningful projects.” Alon shared in the podcast.\n\n“Meme coin projects can integrate additional features, such as NFTs or games, to create long-term value.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• MakerDAO's MKR token surged 11% in 24 hours, hitting a seven-day peak of $1,485, signaling bullish momentum.\n• On-chain data shows a spike in MKR’s active addresses, indicating increased trading activity and investor interest.\n• MKR's price is testing a support level at $1,464. A rally to $1,780 is possible if demand holds, but the bearish sentiment could reverse gains.\n\nMakerDAO’s governance token, MKR, has posted double-digit gains in the past 24 hours, making it the market’s top performer. The surge propelled MKR to a seven-day high of $1,485, where it traded briefly during Thursday’s early Asian hours.\n\nThis signals a renewed bullish momentum for the altcoin and hints at a potential sustained rally.\n\nMKR Demand Strengthens as Market Sees Renewed Investor Interest\n\nOn-chain data reveals a significant spike in MKR’s active address count over the past 24 hours, indicating increased trading activity and investor interest.\n\nAccording to Santiment, MKR’s active address count has surged to a seven-day high of 498, marking an 8% increase in the past 24 hours. An uptick in an asset’s daily active address count suggests growing demand as more market participants engage in transactions.\n\nAs noted by MKR, the sudden spike in this metric indicates a resurgence in bullish bias toward the altcoin.\n\nIf sustained, MKR’s rising active addresses could strengthen the bullish pressure on its price, reinforce liquidity, and strengthen the asset’s overall market presence.\n\nAdditionally, the token’s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) has turned negative, indicating that holders are less incentivized to sell at the current price levels as they hold at a loss. At press time, MKR’s NPL is in a downward trend at -233,000.\n\nThis metric measures investors’ total profit or loss when transferring their assets on-chain. A negative NPL, as seen with MKR, indicates that, on average, investors are selling at a loss.\n\nIf MKR’s NPL remains in negative territory, it could weaken selling pressure, as traders may hesitate to offload their holdings at a loss. This reluctance could create conditions for a sustained MKR rally.\n\nMKR Turns Resistance Into Support—Is a Rally to $1,780 Next?\n\nMKR has flipped the key resistance formed at $1,464 into a support floor. If demand strengthens, the bulls will consolidate their strength and attempt to prevent a price dip below this floor.\n\nIn that scenario, a strong buying pressure could propel MKR toward $1,780, a price high it last reached on February 27.\n\nHowever, a resurgence in bearish bias toward MKR would invalidate this bullish outlook. In that scenario, the altcoin’s price could break below $1,466 and fall to $1,109.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Bitcoin's recent price recovery has investors cautiously optimistic, but volatility remains a concern.\n• Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen nine consecutive days of inflows, signaling growing institutional confidence in the asset.\n• Analysts warn that market volatility, especially due to upcoming tariff announcements, could halt Bitcoin’s momentum.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has shown signs of a relief rally this week, offering a glimmer of hope to investors after the recent market downturn.\n\nDespite this brief uptick, analysts are warning that the upward momentum may not last long.\n\nWill Bitcoin’s Rally Last?\n\nAccording to data from BeInCrypto, Bitcoin’s price has recovered by 2.0% over the past week. The gains have more than doubled over the fortnight, with the coin appreciating by 5.0%. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency traded at $87,381, representing a slight 0.1% dip over the past day.\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also seen inflows for nine consecutive days, according to data from SoSo Value. Since last Friday, the ETFs have collectively attracted $944 million in inflows.\n\nThis sustained interest suggests growing confidence among institutional investors. Yet, analysts are unconvinced of the rally’s potential.\n\nIn its latest Cryptocurrency Compass newsletter, research firm Fairlead Strategies predicted that Bitcoin’s relief rally could persist for another one to two weeks. However, founder Katie Stockton warned that a price drop may follow.\n\n“Intermediate-term momentum is to downside, and the weekly stochastics are not yet oversold, increasing risk that the rebound is fleeting. We expect the same for most risk assets,” she wrote.\n\n“Intermediate-term momentum is to downside, and the weekly stochastics are not yet oversold, increasing risk that the rebound is fleeting. We expect the same for most risk assets,” she wrote.\n\nDespite the bearish outlook, Stockton acknowledged short-term positives. Bitcoin’s near-term momentum has improved, and the price still has room to rise before hitting overbought territory. Nonetheless, she cautioned that this window may close by month’s end.\n\nThis could potentially trigger a phase of consolidation—or “digestion.” This means that Bitcoin’s upward momentum might slow down or pause for a longer period as the market adjusts and absorbs the recent gains.\n\nAnother analyst also shared a cautious outlook. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Koroush AK estimated Bitcoin’s potential price movements using a liquidation heatmap.\n\nHe noted that there’s significant selling pressure around $89,000 (major supply) and buying interest around $85,000 (demand).\n\n“The idea of a HTF dead cat bounce is still valid if price reverts at the highs around the ≈$90K key zone,” he wrote.\n\n“The idea of a HTF dead cat bounce is still valid if price reverts at the highs around the ≈$90K key zone,” he wrote.\n\nFor context, a “dead cat bounce” refers to a temporary recovery or brief upward movement in the price of an asset after a prolonged downtrend. This is followed by a continuation of the downtrend. However, he added that the bearish scenario would be nullified if Bitcoin manages to break past the resistance level.\n\nMeanwhile, changing macroeconomic conditions are also a growing concern, particularly with US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements scheduled for April 2. In their recent report, K33 Research stressed that although markets are currently stable, the upcoming tariff decisions could trigger considerable volatility in the market.\n\n“Tariffs remain the primary producer of market-moving headlines, rendering most traders risk-averse as we approach a big day of tariff announcements on April 2,” the report read.\n\n“Tariffs remain the primary producer of market-moving headlines, rendering most traders risk-averse as we approach a big day of tariff announcements on April 2,” the report read.\n\nThe report further advised caution and recommended avoiding leverage due to the anticipated tariff-induced volatility.\n\nRecently, BeInCrypto also explored how Trump’s tariff plans might impact crypto markets. High tariffs could pressure risk assets like Bitcoin, potentially mirroring the market’s reaction in February. Conversely, if tariffs are delayed or applied selectively, investor fears may ease. This, in turn, could lead to a potential recovery in crypto prices.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Ghibli-themed meme coins are surging in popularity, driven by Studio Ghibli's global influence and AI’s new text-to-image capabilities.\n• OpenAI's GPT-4o update allows users to create Ghibli-style images, fueling viral trends and increasing meme coin interest.\n• The rise of Ghibli tokens on Solana is boosting the ecosystem, though risks like market volatility and copyright concerns loom.\n\nGhibli-themed meme coins are gaining massive attention, with soaring market value and strong community interest.\n\nThis surge is driven by the global influence of Studio Ghibli, an iconic anime brand, and advancements in AI technology, particularly OpenAI’s new Ghibli-style image generation feature.\n\nOpenAI’s New Model Sparks Community Buzz\n\nOpenAI recently updated its GPT-4o model, introducing a text-to-image feature (formerly text-to-video) that allows users to transform regular images into Studio Ghibli’s signature anime style—famous for films like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, and Princess Mononoke.\n\n“We are launching a new thing today—images in ChatGPT!” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on X (formerly Twitter) on March 25, 2025.\n\n“We are launching a new thing today—images in ChatGPT!” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on X (formerly Twitter) on March 25, 2025.\n\nStudio Ghibli’s global fanbase and AI-driven innovations have sparked a new wave of enthusiasm, particularly among anime fans. The feature has gone viral, with social media flooded with Ghibli-style AI-generated images.\n\nEven Shaw, founder of a16z, joined the trend by changing his profile picture to a Ghibli-style avatar featuring the words “Eliza Labs” on a hat and “PARTNERS” on his shirt. This move caught the attention of both the crypto and Ghibli fan communities.\n\nAI’s Impact on the Meme Coin Market\n\nThe GPT-4o update has inspired the creation of Ghibli-themed meme coins, encouraging users to generate and engage with Ghibli-style content. This has triggered a FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) effect, leading investors to rush into these tokens.\n\nNumerous Ghibli-themed tokens have emerged on Pump.fun, DexScreener, and GMGN. Among them, the Ghibli Token on Solana (h9d3…dqs7) stands out as a top performer. According to gmgn.ai, this token recorded a 52.54% surge in just one hour, reaching a market cap of $23 million.\n\nMost of these Ghibli-themed tokens are launched on Solana, boosting its Total Value Locked (TVL) and attracting new users to the ecosystem. Meanwhile, Bitget Seed, a platform focused on promising projects, launched Ghiblification (GHIBLI) Token on March 27, 2025, to capitalize on this trend.\n\nThe hype around these meme coins has also drawn attention from crypto influencers. On X, a user named DeeZe shared their belief in Ghibli tokens’ potential:\n\n“If this AI model had launched three months ago, Ghibli Token could have hit a nine-figure market cap,” said DeeZe\n\n“If this AI model had launched three months ago, Ghibli Token could have hit a nine-figure market cap,” said DeeZe\n\nOpenAI’s Ghibli-style image generation could pave the way for a new wave of pop culture-inspired meme coins. Similar projects may emerge, drawing themes from other anime brands or popular movie franchises, leading to a more diverse meme coin market.\n\nHowever, Ghibli tokens, like all meme coins, are highly volatile. Prices could plummet if FOMO fades. Additionally, Studio Ghibli is known for its strict copyright policies. If the company takes legal action against the unauthorized use of its brand, Ghibli tokens, and similar projects could face legal risks.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.
