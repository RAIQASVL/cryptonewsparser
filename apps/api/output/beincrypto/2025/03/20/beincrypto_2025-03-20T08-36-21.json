    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Following the FOMC meeting, the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped, sparking discussions about Bitcoin's recovery potential.\n• Experts suggest the falling DXY could boost Bitcoin, but caution remains due to ongoing macroeconomic risks like inflation and rising unemployment.\n• Bitcoin’s historical correlation with DXY shows potential for a delayed rally, though analysts warn geopolitical and fiscal factors may impact BTC’s trajectory.\n\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) fell following the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. This turnout triggered discussions about its implications for Bitcoin (BTC) and broader liquidity conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin price reclaimed the $85,000 range. However, prospects for more gains remain debatable as the pioneer crypto continues in a horizontal chop.\n\nFed Revises Economic Projections Amid Growth Concerns\n\nMarket analysts and crypto experts suggest the declining dollar could create a more favorable environment for Bitcoin’s price recovery. This optimism comes despite lingering macroeconomic concerns.\n\nOn one hand, President Donald Trump is putting political pressure on the Federal Reserve (Fed), urging it to cut rates.\n\n“The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing,”  Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing,”  Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThese remarks indicate potential political battles over monetary policy, further affecting risk asset performance.\n\nHowever, the FOMC rejected further interest rate cuts, and the Fed made significant downward revisions to its 2025 economic projections. This painted a picture of weaker growth and persistent inflation.\n\nThe Fed cut its GDP growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7% while raising its unemployment projection to 4.4%. Inflation expectations also increased, with PCE inflation forecasted at 2.7% and core PCE inflation at 2.8%. Notably, both of these were higher than previous estimates.\n\nThese revisions suggest a more challenging economic environment, with the DXY dropping in the aftermath.\n\nReal Vision’s chief crypto analyst, Jamie Coutts, who also built the crypto research product at Bloomberg Intelligence, commented on the turnout. In a post on X (Twitter), the analyst argued that quantitative tightening (QT) is effectively dead for the near future.\n\nCoutts points to the decline in Treasury yield volatility and its correlation with the DXY downturn. He says these are key indicators of increased liquidity, which is generally bullish for Bitcoin.\n\n“After last night, QT is effectively dead (for some time). Treasury volatility has backed right off and is now mirroring the decline in DXY from earlier this month. This is all extremely liquidity-positive,” Coutts noted.\n\n“After last night, QT is effectively dead (for some time). Treasury volatility has backed right off and is now mirroring the decline in DXY from earlier this month. This is all extremely liquidity-positive,” Coutts noted.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees on the extent of QT’s slowdown. Analyst Benjamin Cowen cautions that QT is still ongoing, albeit at a reduced pace.\n\n“QT is not ‘basically over’ on April 1st. They still have $35 billion per month coming off from mortgage-backed securities. They just slowed QT from $60 billion per month to $40 billion per month,” Cowen wrote.\n\n“QT is not ‘basically over’ on April 1st. They still have $35 billion per month coming off from mortgage-backed securities. They just slowed QT from $60 billion per month to $40 billion per month,” Cowen wrote.\n\nBitcoin and the Dollar: A Delayed Reaction?\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments for Bitcoin’s potential recovery comes from VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Mathew Sigel. He points out that Bitcoin has historically tracked an inverted DXY on a 10-week lag. This suggests that the current downturn in BTC prices could be a delayed reaction to the strong dollar in late 2024.\n\nIf the pattern holds, the recent weakness in DXY could set the stage for a bullish phase in Bitcoin over the coming months.\n\nMeanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is more cautious about Bitcoin’s trajectory. While he acknowledges that QT is slowing, he questions whether liquidity injections in the European Union—driven by military spending—could overshadow the US’s financial shifts.\n\n“Will the re-arming of the EU paid for with printed EUR overwhelm the near-term negative fiscal impulse of the US? That’s the big macro question. If yes, correction over. If no, hold on to your butts,” Hayes wrote.\n\n“Will the re-arming of the EU paid for with printed EUR overwhelm the near-term negative fiscal impulse of the US? That’s the big macro question. If yes, correction over. If no, hold on to your butts,” Hayes wrote.\n\nHayes also speculated that Bitcoin’s recent drop to $77,000 might have marked the bottom. However, he warned that traditional markets might face further downside, which could influence crypto in the short term.\n\nBased on these, the post-FOMC environment presents a mixed outlook for Bitcoin. On the one hand, falling DXY, lower Treasury yield volatility, and slowing QT point to increasing liquidity, a historically positive signal for BTC.\n\nOn the other hand, macroeconomic risks—including rising corporate bond spreads and potential instability in traditional markets—could still create headwinds.\n\nWith Bitcoin’s historical lag behind DXY movements, the coming weeks will reveal if a delayed rally materializes. Meanwhile, global liquidity conditions and political developments remain key factors that could influence Bitcoin’s next major move.\n\nBeInCrypto data shows BTC was trading for $85,832 at press time. This represents a modest gain of almost 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Coinbase now operates 120,000 validators, controlling 11.42% of total staked Ethereum, making it the largest individual node operator.\n• The company reports 99.75% validator participation and uptime, with no slashing or double-signing, ensuring user asset security.\n• As Coinbase grows its Ethereum stake, concerns arise about network decentralization, with some questioning the risks of centralization.\n\nCoinbase released its first Ethereum Validator Performance Report, revealing that it now operates 120,000 validators managing 3.84 million staked Ethereum (ETH) tokens.\n\nWith this accounting for 11.42% of the total staked Ethereum, Coinbase is the largest individual node operator on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Ethereum Stakers on Coinbase Should Know\n\nThe report highlights key metrics such as a 99.75% participation rate and uptime, ensuring that staked assets continue generating rewards efficiently. Coinbase also reported no instances of slashing or double signing, which means users’ funds have remained secure. These findings could have significant implications for users who stake ETH through the platform.\n\nOne of the main concerns for users staking ETH is security. Coinbase has emphasized that it prioritizes avoiding slashing penalties over maximizing uptime. This means users may experience slightly lower returns than platforms pushing for near-100% uptime.\n\nFurther, the company distributes its validators across multiple countries and cloud providers (AWS and GCP), reducing the likelihood of service disruptions. Another crucial factor for users is client diversity. Coinbase’s goal of multiple execution and consensus clients is to prevent single points of failure.\n\nHowever, as the largest individual operator, Coinbase’s influence over the Ethereum network is increasing. Some stakeholders may be concerned about centralization risks as Coinbase’s share of the Ethereum network grows.\n\nIndeed, Coinbase’s growing share has raised questions about Ethereum’s decentralization as large operators increase their influence over network governance.\n\n“11.42% stake concentration in a single entity raises red flags for network security. Transparency is good, but decentralization is better. We need more distributed validation,” a user commented in a post on X (Twitter).\n\n“11.42% stake concentration in a single entity raises red flags for network security. Transparency is good, but decentralization is better. We need more distributed validation,” a user commented in a post on X (Twitter).\n\nUsers may need to weigh the convenience of staking with the Coinbase exchange against the broader implications of network centralization.\n\nEthereum educator Sassal acknowledged that Coinbase’s 11.42% share makes it the largest Ethereum node operator. However, Lido, another ETH staking protocol, remains the largest staking entity when considering its collective stake across multiple operators.\n\n“We now know how much ETH Coinbase has staked (11.42% of the total stake). This, of course, makes Coinbase the single largest node operator on the network (Lido is bigger as a collective, but each node operator has a much smaller % share) Kudos to Coinbase for the transparency!,” Sassal remarked.\n\n“We now know how much ETH Coinbase has staked (11.42% of the total stake). This, of course, makes Coinbase the single largest node operator on the network (Lido is bigger as a collective, but each node operator has a much smaller % share) Kudos to Coinbase for the transparency!,” Sassal remarked.\n\nMeanwhile, the report follows a period of mixed developments for the company. Recent findings indicate that traffic to centralized exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, dropped by nearly 30%, reflecting the impact of a declining crypto market.\n\nNotwithstanding, Coinbase has expanded its offerings with the launch of Verified Liquidity Pools, aimed at both institutional and retail traders.\n\nAdditionally, Coinbase recently saw a legal development as the SEC dropped a high-profile lawsuit against the company. The lawsuit had been a source of uncertainty for Coinbase and the broader crypto industry, making its dismissal a notable event.\n\n“Are they releasing these things now because SEC is off their back,” one user posed.\n\n“Are they releasing these things now because SEC is off their back,” one user posed.\n\nWith its increasing share of staked Ethereum, Coinbase’s role in the network will likely continue to be debated. While the company has taken steps to maintain client diversity and decentralization, its influence over Ethereum’s staking ecosystem remains significant.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

This sharp drop has wiped out a significant portion of its rally.\n\nHowever, with changing market conditions and shifting investor sentiment, MUBARAK could be poised for a recovery.\n\nMUBARAK Traders Are Optimistic\n\nMUBARAK’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has recently shown an uptick, signaling a shift in investor behavior. Over the last few hours, the inflows have outpaced outflows, suggesting a positive outlook for the market.\n\nThis increase in investment interest points to a potential price recovery for the meme coin in the near term. The growing optimism in the market could be pivotal in supporting MUBARAK’s rebound.\n\nDespite the recent volatility, the positive shift in CMF indicates that investors are beginning to regain confidence in MUBARAK. As more capital flows into the asset, the selling pressure appears to be easing.\n\nThe overall macro momentum for MUBARAK appears to be leaning towards a recovery, as reflected in the positive funding rate. Traders are currently placing long contracts on the asset, which has resulted in a favorable funding rate. This indicates that there is a belief among traders that MUBARAK will continue to rise, reflecting a shift toward optimism.\n\nThis bullish sentiment from traders is essential for sustaining a recovery. As long as the funding rate remains positive and long positions continue to dominate, MUBARAK could see additional support for upward movement.\n\nMUBARAK Price Rise Ahead\n\nMUBARAK’s price fell by 21% in the last 48 hours, dropping to $0.142, just under the key resistance of $0.149. Despite the decline, the coin has shown signs of recovery. If the positive trends in CMF and funding rates persist, MUBARAK could break through the $0.149 resistance, aiming for $0.173 or higher.\n\nWith the recent uptick in market sentiment, the potential for MUBARAK to breach $0.149 is strong. A successful breakout could see the meme coin moving higher, possibly revisiting previous highs. A sustained rally would likely push the price further, confirming that the recovery is underway.\n\nHowever, if the investors shift back to a selling stance, the bullish outlook could be invalidated. In such a scenario, MUBARAK could face significant outflows, pushing the altcoin’s price back down to $0.105 or potentially as low as $0.086.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

Moreover, it signals a shift toward a more sustainable and rewarding ecosystem.\n\n“These campaigns will lead to other benefits for the Uniswap community. For example, 65% of Unichain net chain revenue is set to be earned by UVN validators and stakers, once the UVN launches,” the proposal noted.\n\n“These campaigns will lead to other benefits for the Uniswap community. For example, 65% of Unichain net chain revenue is set to be earned by UVN validators and stakers, once the UVN launches,” the proposal noted.\n\nThe first proposal outlines the Uniswap Foundation’s strategic priorities for 2025 and beyond. It focuses on four key areas. The first is scaling network supply by optimizing liquidity across active Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains.\n\nThe second priority is scaling network demand by developing platforms that encourage DeFi innovation and attract developers. This includes initiatives such as funding programs, infrastructure development, and educational resources. These aim to support developers throughout the hook development lifecycle.\n\nIn addition, the third priority is strengthening governance by activating revenue sources and onboarding new protocol contributors. It emphasizes distributing a portion of Unichain’s net chain revenue to validators and stakers and exploring the creation of a legal entity for governance purposes.\n\nLastly, the proposal aims to establish a Core Contributor Program. This program will create incentive-aligned development teams to advance the protocol and ecosystem.\n\nThe proposal also includes a total investment of $120.5 million, with $95.4 million allocated to the foundation’s grant budget and $25.1 million designated for operational costs.\n\n“It reflects an investment into the success of the Uniswap Protocol and Unichain, and into value for the Uniswap community, and will be backstopped by best-in-industry transparency reporting and an unrelenting drive to create value,” the proposal read.\n\n“It reflects an investment into the success of the Uniswap Protocol and Unichain, and into value for the Uniswap community, and will be backstopped by best-in-industry transparency reporting and an unrelenting drive to create value,” the proposal read.\n\nThe second proposal, which included input from Gauntlet, focuses on funding two liquidity incentive programs to drive growth for Uniswap v4 and Unichain. Thus, the primary objective is to attract liquidity providers (LPs), swappers, and developers to these platforms, which will play key roles in DeFi’s future. The Uniswap Foundation requested a $45 million budget to support these liquidity incentives.\n\nThe Aera platform will be used to ensure full governance control over the funds. This platform will allow Uniswap Governance to recall unused funds if necessary. Gauntlet has already set up an Aera vault on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet.\n\nFurthermore, with the proposal’s approval, the vault will be resumed. A total of 7,588,532 UNI tokens will be deposited to fund ongoing liquidity incentives.\n\nMeanwhile, UNI reacted positively to the news. According to data from BeInCrypto, its value surged by 7.5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nAt press time, UNI was trading at $6.8. Additionally, trading volume saw a remarkable 207.9% spike, further highlighting a substantial increase in activity.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• The total crypto market cap rose by $97 billion, breaking past $2.75 trillion but faces uncertain momentum with $2.93 trillion as the next resistance.\n• Bitcoin's price rose by 3.79%, breaching the $85,000 resistance, targeting $89,800 as the next key level to confirm a bullish trend.\n• XRP saw an 8% increase but struggles against the $2.60 resistance; a failure to break this could lead to a decline towards $2.33 or lower.\n\nThe total crypto market cap (TOTAL) and Bitcoin (BTC) noted recovery over the last 24 hours owing to improved macro-financial conditions. Altcoins benefitted from the same, and XRP (XRP) took the spot of the day’s best performer with an 8% rise.\n\nIn the news today:-\n\nPi Network’s community sentiment poll on CoinMarketCap saw a sharp decline today, with allegations of bot activity influencing negative votes. Despite no clear evidence, the network’s supporters have previously swayed polls and ratings amid ongoing criticism and price setbacks.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump will speak at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 20, marking the first time a sitting US president attends a crypto conference. This follows his hosting of the White House Crypto Summit, which provided key updates on the US Bitcoin Reserve and regulatory stance.\n\nThe Crypto Market Recovers\n\nThe total crypto market cap saw a $97 billion increase in the last 24 hours, reflecting mixed investor responses to the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain US interest rates. The market’s reaction remains uncertain as it remains sensitive to broader economic signals.\n\nTOTAL is currently trading at $2.77 trillion, having broken past the $2.75 trillion barrier. This move suggests that the market could be aiming for the next significant resistance level at $2.93 trillion. However, this upward momentum depends on the $2.75 trillion mark being sustained as support in the near future.\n\nIf the bearish sentiment prevails, the total crypto market cap could slide back below the $2.75 trillion level, potentially testing $2.61 trillion as a new support zone. This scenario would likely stem from renewed market concerns, signaling a shift in investor confidence.\n\nBitcoin Breaks Above Key Barrier\n\nBitcoin’s price increased by 3.79% today, reaching $85,846. This rise follows a successful breach of the $85,000 resistance, ending a week-long period of consolidation above $80,301. This bullish move signals that Bitcoin may continue upward provided the momentum is sustained in the coming days.\n\nFor Bitcoin to recover its previous losses, it must hold above the current support and aim for higher targets. The next key resistance level sits at $89,800, with a potential push towards $90,000. A successful breach of these levels could confirm the start of a stronger uptrend for Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, if investor sentiment turns bearish, Bitcoin could experience a pullback. A failure to maintain support at $85,000 may trigger a decline back into consolidation, possibly testing $80,301 again. This would delay Bitcoin’s recovery, keeping it within the current range.\n\nXRP Faces Resistance\n\nXRP emerged as the top performer today, with an 8% rise. However, the broader market’s uncertainty is limiting substantial growth. Most other cryptocurrencies are experiencing similar minimal gains or declines.\n\nXRP has yet to establish strong bullish momentum as it struggles against the $2.60 resistance level. If XRP manages to breach this barrier, it could potentially push toward the $2.95 level, a key resistance it failed to overcome earlier this month. This would signal a potential recovery for the altcoin.\n\nIf XRP fails to break through the $2.60 barrier, it may see a decline back to the support of $2.33 or lower. This would erase the recent gains and invalidate the bullish outlook. A fall to $2.14 or below could further dampen investor sentiment and delay any recovery.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• BNB meme coins surge as PancakeSwap leads global DEX volumes, outperforming Raydium and Uniswap this week.\n• Mubarak, Palu, and FairMint dominate BNB’s meme coin scene, each posting strong activity despite sharp corrections.\n• Mubarak nears $200 million market cap, Palu eyes $1 million rebound, and FairMint aims to become BNB’s leading launchpad.\n\nBNB meme coins are gaining traction as the BNB ecosystem experiences a surge. PancakeSwap has been leading DEX volumes globally over the past seven days, surpassing both Raydium and Uniswap.\n\nAmong the top contenders making waves are Mubarak, Palu, and FairMint, each capturing significant attention in this fast-moving space. Mubarak is leading the pack with explosive early growth, while Palu is emerging as a potential flagship meme coin. Meanwhile, FairMint is positioning itself as a unique launchpad, aiming to become BNB’s version of Pumpfun.\n\nMubarak\n\nMubarak has quickly become one of the most talked-about meme coins in the BNB ecosystem over the past few days. Yesterday, its market cap briefly approached the $200 million mark before pulling back to around $112 million today.\n\nThe project surged onto the scene with remarkable traction, fueled by growing hype and speculative interest in BNB-based assets.\n\nIn just a short period, Mubarak has gained over 20,000 holders, recorded daily volumes of $66 million, and witnessed nearly 35,000 transactions per day. However, despite this initial momentum, the token is now undergoing a sharp correction, down 25% in the past 24 hours.\n\nEven so, with the BNB ecosystem continuing to attract fresh capital and broader market attention, there is still potential for Mubarak to rebound and possibly retest its previous highs near the $200 million market cap level if buying interest returns.\n\nBinance’s Palu (Palu)\n\nAs BNB meme coins continue to dominate the spotlight, several projects are competing to become the face of the ecosystem, much like Shiba Inu did with Ethereum and Bonk with Solana.\n\nOne of the contenders is Palu, a relatively new token launched just under six days ago. Palu has already attracted nearly 5,000 holders and reached a market cap of $864,000, slightly down from its recent high of almost $900,000.\n\nThe project is positioning itself to potentially fill the role of a flagship meme coin within the BNB chain.\n\nDespite suffering a sharp 75% correction over the past 24 hours – a scenario not uncommon among meme coins across various blockchains – Palu is still maintaining solid activity, with daily trading volumes near $4 million.\n\nIf sentiment in the BNB meme coins sector stabilizes and Palu regains its momentum, the project could attempt to climb back toward key psychological milestones, with market cap targets of around $1 million and possibly even $2 million in the near term.\n\nFairMint FAIR (FAIR)\n\nFairMint is a newly launched BNB meme coins launchpad that has been live for less than three days.\n\nTrying to differentiate itself from other platforms such as Pumpfun, FairMint introduces distinctive mechanics.\n\nFor example, it enables all users to mint tokens at the same price while also ensuring that 95% of tokens maintain liquidity at the mint price via single-sided liquidity provisioning.\n\nCurrently, FairMint has gathered close to 3,500 holders, boasts a daily trading volume of $11.7 million, and records over 24,000 transactions per day.\n\nWhile Pumpfun has established itself as the leading launchpad on Solana, the BNB chain still lacks a dominant player in this niche.\n\nIf FairMint can sustain its strong early momentum and community engagement, FairMint could be poised to push toward market cap milestones of $5 million and potentially even $10 million in the coming days.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Hyperliquid generated $47 million in fees over the past 30 days, outperforming major blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.\n• Unlike most protocols that operate on established networks, Hyperliquid functions as its own independent chain.\n• Technical indicators including rising DMI, RSI at 66, and approaching golden cross suggest HYPE could break above $20 soon.\n\nHyperliquid (HYPE) is showing strong technical signals across multiple indicators, with the token surging more than 15% in the last 24 hours. The platform continues to demonstrate impressive market performance, generating $47 million in fees over the past 30 days and outperforming major blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana.\n\nTechnical indicators suggest a potential golden cross formation, meaning HYPE could test $21 or even $25.80 in the coming period.\n\nHyperliquid Revenue Places It Among Top Protocols In Crypto\n\nHyperliquid is currently one of the most successful protocols in crypto. Over the past 30 days, it has generated an impressive $47 million in fees and recently reached $1 trillion in perps volume.\n\nWhile this places it behind major players such as Jito, Pumpfun, and PancakeSwap in terms of monthly revenue, Hyperliquid has surpassed significant blockchain apps and chains, including Solana, Ethereum, Raydium, and Phantom.\n\nWhat makes Hyperliquid’s success particularly remarkable is that, unlike most other high-performing protocols that operate on established blockchain networks such as BNB, Solana, or Ethereum, Hyperliquid functions as its own independent chain.\n\nWith the exception of Tron, virtually all other major protocols rely on parent blockchains, whereas Hyperliquid has achieved its substantial revenue figures as a standalone entity.\n\nDespite this impressive performance and unique positioning, HYPE has experienced considerable downward price pressure recently, trading below the $20 threshold for sixteen consecutive days, creating a notable disconnect between the protocol’s operational success and its market valuation.\n\nHYPE DMI Shows Buyers Are In Control\n\nThe HYPE DMI (Directional Movement Index) chart shows promising momentum shifts, with the ADX (Average Directional Index) rising from 15.7 to 19, suggesting a strengthening trend conviction.\n\nMore significantly, the +DI (Positive Directional Indicator) has surged from 18 to 29.1, while the -DI (Negative Directional Indicator) has declined from 21.8 to 13.5. This crossover pattern, where +DI rises above -DI, typically signals a potential bullish reversal.\n\nThe increasing spread between these indicators and the rising ADX suggests that buying pressure is overcoming selling pressure, potentially setting the stage for HYPE to break above its recent sub-$20 trading range.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. Readings above 70 are typically considered overbought, and below 30 are considered oversold.\n\nHYPE’s RSI climbing from 54.5 to 66 indicates growing bullish momentum that hasn’t yet reached extreme levels. This uptick suggests strengthening buyer interest while remaining below the overbought threshold of 70.\n\nThe fact that HYPE hasn’t reached overbought levels since December 2024 implies there may still be room for price appreciation before any potential pullback.\n\nTogether with the DMI indicators, this RSI reading reinforces the possibility of continued upward movement in HYPE’s price in the near term.\n\nWill Hyperliquid Rise Above $20 This Week?\n\nThe HYPE Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines are converging toward a potential golden cross formation, which occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term one.\n\nThis technical pattern typically signals a strong bullish momentum shift that could propel HYPE to test its immediate resistance level at $17. Should buyers successfully break through this threshold, the path would open for HYPE to climb toward the $21 mark.\n\nIn scenarios where exceptional buying pressure materializes, Hyperliquid could extend its gains to challenge the significant resistance level at $25.80, representing a substantial recovery from its recent sub-$20 trading range.\n\nConversely, if the anticipated uptrend fails to materialize and bearish sentiment prevails, HYPE could experience renewed downward pressure, forcing it to test the critical support level at $12.43.\n\nThe importance of this support cannot be overstated, as a breach below this floor could trigger accelerated selling, potentially pushing HYPE under the psychologically significant $12 level for the first time since December 2024.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

The project aims to revitalize the Notcoin (NOT) ecosystem by introducing games where players can earn tokens for free.\n\nOpen Builders revealed this plan at a time when interest in Telegram-based mini-games has dropped significantly, and TON’s user base has fallen to its lowest level in a year.\n\nNotcoin (NOT) Seeks to Renew User Interest Through Not Games\n\nIn a press release shared with BeInCrypto, Open Builders clarified that Not Games is not a standalone game on Telegram. Instead, it is an interconnected gaming ecosystem that links multiple titles.\n\nWithin this ecosystem, Open Builders will introduce Game Profiles, shared inventories, and an in-game marketplace where players can trade with each other. This system gives the NOT token a broader use case, and it’s expected to transform the token from a simple tap-to-earn reward into a valuable asset within the gaming economy.\n\n“Instead of fragmented tokenomics, Not Games will integrate NOT as the primary currency for purchases, upgrades, and rewards across all games. Every three weeks, the most skilled players will compete for rewards in NOT, ensuring a play-to-win experience, rather than a pay-to-win model.” – the Notcoin team told BeInCrypto.\n\n“Instead of fragmented tokenomics, Not Games will integrate NOT as the primary currency for purchases, upgrades, and rewards across all games. Every three weeks, the most skilled players will compete for rewards in NOT, ensuring a play-to-win experience, rather than a pay-to-win model.” – the Notcoin team told BeInCrypto.\n\nCurrently, Open Builders has already launched a game called VOID and confirmed that at least five more games are in development.\n\nTap-to-Earn and TON’s Shrinking User Base\n\nNotcoin (NOT) gained massive popularity in 2024, driven by the tap-to-earn trend alongside projects like Hamster Kombat (HMSTR) and Yescoin, TapSwap, and Blum. Within the first six months of 2024, Notcoin attracted 35 million players.\n\nHowever, Google Trends data indicates that interest in Notcoin has sharply declined and has nearly faded by 2025.\n\nAdditionally, Tgstat data reveals that the Notcoin Community’s Telegram membership has dropped by nearly 2 million since the beginning of the year.\n\nEven after NOT’s listing on Kraken in mid-February, its price only surged briefly on the listing day before continuing its downward trend, hitting new lows in 2025. This suggests that investor interest in NOT has faded.\n\nMoreover, Artemis data shows that daily active addresses on The Open Network (TON) have dropped from 2.4 million in October 2024 to just 130,000 at the time of writing.\n\nThe declining TON user base poses a major challenge for Notcoin (NOT) and its efforts to build a sustainable ecosystem.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Pi Network's community sentiment poll on CoinMarketCap dropped 90% in a day, leading to allegations of bot sabotage.\n• Despite claims, there’s no concrete proof to support bot involvement, though PI community's history of vote brigading raises suspicion.\n• The poll's unusual speed and scope, compared to other crypto assets, fuels speculation about external interference in PI's ratings.\n\nPi Network’s community sentiment poll on CoinMarketCap fell dramatically today, leading to allegations of bot activity. Negative votes swarmed the site’s poll, while other community ratings stayed positive.\n\nHowever, there is no clear proof either for or against these claims. Pi Network has suffered criticism and price setbacks recently, and its supporters have swayed polls, votes, and ratings on multiple occasions.\n\nDid Bots Sabotage Pi Network’s Community Sentiment?\n\nSince its launch on February 20, Pi Network has seen more than its share of controversies. Critics have attacked its accessibility, governance, transparency, and more, and multiple governments have called it a scam.\n\nToday, however, Pi supporters raised concerns about bot activity on CoinMarketCap after the token’s community sentiment plummeted:\n\n“It looks like somebody is using bots to vote against PI. I am 99% sure this is not an organic poll. Over 1.94 Million votes is even bigger than the BTC vote. 77% of the PI community is bullish on CoinGecko. Why is it so different on CoinMarketCap?” a Pioneer asked on social media.\n\n“It looks like somebody is using bots to vote against PI. I am 99% sure this is not an organic poll. Over 1.94 Million votes is even bigger than the BTC vote. 77% of the PI community is bullish on CoinGecko. Why is it so different on CoinMarketCap?” a Pioneer asked on social media.\n\nSpecifically, this user noted that Pi’s community sentiment plunged 90% in less than a day and that this poll had more participants than Bitcoin’s.\n\nOther platforms with a similar voting mechanism kept Pi’s rating steady, leading him to conclude that bot activity was involved.\n\nIt’s very difficult to assess the veracity of these Pi Network bot allegations for several reasons. First of all, the token’s price has suffered dramatically this week.\n\nMany users lost huge sums of Pi tokens after the KYC migration deadline, and massive investor sell-offs have triggered a price rout. Some of this negative sentiment may be genuine.\n\nAdditionally, it’s interesting that CoinMarketCap is the only platform involved in the Pi Network bot voting allegations. The firm refused to acknowledge Pi as one of the largest tokens by market cap, but it eventually relented.\n\nEither the platform or its community could bear resentment towards Pi after these setbacks.\n\nFurthermore, the community does have a reputation for vote brigading. Bybit’s CEO has repeatedly criticized Pi, and the token’s supporters review-bombed the Bybit app in response. They did a similar practice with Binance after the exchange delayed a Pi listing.\n\nUltimately, it seems very unlikely that disgruntled Pi supporters or committed haters spiked this poll without any bot activity. The negative votes came in absurdly fast, were isolated to one platform, and exceeded the votes for even the largest cryptoassets.\n\nAs of now, it remains challenging to find definitive proof either way.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.
