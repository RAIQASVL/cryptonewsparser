    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao signs a partnership with Kyrgyzstan to develop its Web3 and blockchain ecosystem.\n• Kyrgyzstan's A7A5 stablecoin, pegged to the Russian ruble, targets emerging markets and digital assets.\n• CZ is advising several governments on crypto regulations, including helping Kyrgyzstan with blockchain education and infrastructure.\n\nChangpeng “CZ” Zhao, former CEO of Binance, is advising Kyrgyzstan on becoming a crypto hub. He signed an agreement with the Kyrgyz National Investment Agency to build the nation’s Web3 capacities.\n\nA cornerstone of this plan is Kyrgyzstan’s A7A5 stablecoin, pegged to the Russian ruble and focused on emerging markets. CZ claimed that he has been advising several governments “officially and unofficially” regarding crypto.\n\nCZ Helps Kyrgyzstan Drive Crypto Adoption\n\nCountries worldwide are becoming more interested in crypto integration lately. Although Kyrgyzstan has not been a particular hub for crypto activity, it is trying to turn a new leaf.\n\nAccording to the latest announcements, the country is developing a new A7A5 stablecoin pegged to the Russian ruble. Kyrgyzstan’s crypto turn is also being influenced by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder of Binance.\n\n“A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the National Investment Agency under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic and Changpeng Zhao (CZ). In accordance with the Memorandum, the parties intend to cooperate in the development of the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology ecosystem in the Kyrgyz Republic,” claimed President Sadyr Zhaparov.\n\n“A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the National Investment Agency under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic and Changpeng Zhao (CZ). In accordance with the Memorandum, the parties intend to cooperate in the development of the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology ecosystem in the Kyrgyz Republic,” claimed President Sadyr Zhaparov.\n\nCZ is a very influential figure in crypto and has been involved with a few official governments in his career. For example, last month, allegations surfaced that he was working with President Trump to establish a new dollar-backed stablecoin.\n\nMeanwhile, CZ acknowledged his business in Kyrgyzstan, claiming that he introduced President Zhaparov to X, the social media site.\n\n“I officially and unofficially advise a few governments on their crypto regulatory frameworks and blockchain solutions for gov efficiency, expanding blockchain to more than trading. I find this work extremely meaningful,” CZ claimed via social media.\n\n“I officially and unofficially advise a few governments on their crypto regulatory frameworks and blockchain solutions for gov efficiency, expanding blockchain to more than trading. I find this work extremely meaningful,” CZ claimed via social media.\n\nAlthough CZ’s connection with Kyrgyzstan’s new A7A5 stablecoin is not fully known, it would align with his recent alleged Trump dealings.\n\nZhaparov’s statement claimed that the Binance founder will provide infrastructural, technological support, technical expertise, and consulting services on crypto and blockchain technologies.\n\nAlso, the president went on to state that this agreement with CZ will strengthen Kyrgyzstan’s standing in the growing Web3 environment. The long-term plan is to help create new opportunities for Kyrgyz businesses and society as a whole.\n\nPresumably, this will involve some cooperation with Russia, as A7A5’s press release mentions “a new class of digital assets tied to the Russian economy.” This stablecoin is bucking significant tradition by aligning with the ruble instead of the dollar.\n\nHowever, this is part of its strategy to focus on emerging markets. This novel experiment could demonstrate new market opportunities and challenge the dominance of USD-pegged stablecoins in the region.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

In 2024, the exchange received $2.6 billion of a total of $2.7 billion in rewards, amounting to 94% of the entire market segment.\n\nIn an exclusive press release shared with BeInCrypto, Binance also revealed that it’s making substantial changes to its airdrop services to improve user experience and make participation easier.\n\nBinance Leads the Market in Crypto Airdrops\n\nBinance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has become the go-to platform for airdrops and staking rewards. It launched the HODLer airdrop program less than a year ago, providing many new projects with a comprehensive platform to reward early adopters.\n\nIn the past year, the exchange has become synonymous with the latest airdrops, as most users are accessing their rewards through the platform.\n\nBased on this impressive performance in the airdrop sector, Binance has substantially upgraded a few of its services. The platform has revamped its Launchpool and BNB Earn pages, making it easier for users to both track and participate in airdrops.\n\n“With these upgrades, we’re making it easier than ever for users to unlock the full potential of BNB and participate in high-quality token launches. The redesigned Binance Launchpool and BNB pages reflect our commitment to user education, simplicity, and maximizing rewards,” said Jeff Li, VP of Product at Binance.\n\n“With these upgrades, we’re making it easier than ever for users to unlock the full potential of BNB and participate in high-quality token launches. The redesigned Binance Launchpool and BNB pages reflect our commitment to user education, simplicity, and maximizing rewards,” said Jeff Li, VP of Product at Binance.\n\nThe updated BNB page will give Binance users key benefits, such as real-time information on airdrops across its platforms, including Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer Airdrops.\n\nUsers will also see features like trading fee discounts, VIP perks, and a historical rewards section. These improvements are designed to help the firm maintain its significant dominance while continuing to focus on integrity.\n\nHopefully, these improvements will allow the firm to maintain its significant dominance while maintaining its usual integrity. Last month, Binance Research identified some systemic problems with airdrops in general, and the exchange seems particularly concerned with its reputation.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Ethereum's March struggle saw its price dip to a two-year low and network activity decline, causing downward pressure on ETH.\n• Despite increased supply, experts argue Ethereum’s moderate inflation rate of 0.73% isn’t a major concern, with macro factors playing a bigger role.\n• April’s ETH performance will likely depend more on market sentiment and broader trends than short-term supply fluctuations or network activity.\n\nThe leading altcoin, Ethereum, experienced a challenging month in March, marked by a series of bearish trends that reflected a broader market slowdown.\n\nHowever, as the market begins to show signs of recovery, the key question for April remains: Can Ethereum regain its bullish momentum?\n\nEthereum’s March Woes: Price Crash, Activity Slump, and Growing Supply Pressure\n\nOn March 11, Ethereum plummeted to a two-year low of $1,759. This prompted traders to “buy the dip,” triggering a rally to $2,104 by March 24.\n\nHowever, market participants resumed profit-taking, causing the coin’s price to fall sharply for the rest of the month. On March 31, ETH closed below the critical $2,000 price level at $1,822.\n\nAmid ETH’s price troubles, the Ethereum network also experienced a severe decline in activity in March. Per Artemis, the daily count of active addresses that completed at least one ETH transaction fell by 20% in March.\n\nAs a result, the network’s monthly transaction count also plummeted. Totaling 1.06 million during the 31-day period in review, the number of transactions completed on Ethereum fell by 21% in March.\n\nGenerally, as more users transact and engage with Ethereum, the burn rate (a measure of ETH tokens permanently removed from circulation) increases, contributing to Ether’s deflationary supply dynamic. However, when user activity drops,  ETH’s burn rate reduces, leaving many coins in circulation and adding to its circulating supply.\n\nThis was the case for ETH in March when it saw a spike in its circulating supply. According to data from Ultrasound Money, 74,322.37 coins have been added to ETH’s circulating supply in the past 30 days.\n\nUsually, when an asset’s supply spikes like this without a corresponding demand to absorb it, it increases the downward pressure on its price. This puts ETH at risk of extending its decline in April.\n\nWhat’s Next for Ethereum? Expert Says Inflation May Not Be a Major Concern\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, Gabriel Halm, a Research Analyst at IntoTheBlock, noted that ETH’s current inflationary trends “may not be a major red flag” to watch out for in April.\n\nHalm said:\n\n“Even though Ethereum’s supply has recently stopped being deflationary, its annualized inflation rate is still only 0.73% over the last month, which is still dramatically lower than pre-Merge levels and lower than that of Bitcoin. For investors, this moderate level of inflation may not be a major red flag, provided that network usage, developer activity, and institutional adoption remain robust.”\n\n“Even though Ethereum’s supply has recently stopped being deflationary, its annualized inflation rate is still only 0.73% over the last month, which is still dramatically lower than pre-Merge levels and lower than that of Bitcoin. For investors, this moderate level of inflation may not be a major red flag, provided that network usage, developer activity, and institutional adoption remain robust.”\n\nMoreover, regarding whether Ethereum’s declining network activity has played a significant role in its recent price struggles, Halm suggested that its impact may be overstated.\n\n“Historically, from September 2022 to early 2024, Ethereum’s supply remained deflationary, yet the ETH/BTC pair still trended lower. This suggests that macroeconomic and broader market forces can play a far more significant role than token supply changes alone.”\n\n“Historically, from September 2022 to early 2024, Ethereum’s supply remained deflationary, yet the ETH/BTC pair still trended lower.

Still, it’s essential to keep an eye on network developments that could spur renewed activity and reinforce ETH’s leading position in the broader crypto landscape.”\n\n“Ultimately, whether Ethereum dips or rallies in April will likely depend more on market sentiment and macro trends than on its short-term supply dynamics.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• MANTRA (OM) holds bullish momentum despite a 1% decline, and a positive Balance of Power suggests a potential recovery toward $9.17.\n• Qubic (QUBIC) faces growing selling pressure as its price drops 8%, signaling a bearish trend with a potential decline to $0.000000699.\n• Toncoin (TON) sees an 11% dip and faces resistance at $4.21, with a potential further decline to $2.82 or rebound to $5.22.\n\nThe crypto market experienced a downturn over the past 24 hours, with the total market capitalization dropping by $64 billion to settle at $2.64 trillion at press time.\n\nAmid the pullback, certain altcoins have continued to attract attention. They include MANTRA (OM), VICE (VICE), and Qubic (QUBIC).\n\nMANTRA (OM)\n\nOM is one of today’s trending altcoins. It is down 1% over the past day and trades at $6.32 at the time of writing.\n\nHowever, readings from OM’s daily chart suggest that the bullish bias toward it remains significant and that its price decline in the past 24 hours merely mirrors market trends.\n\nFor example, the token’s Balance of Power (BoP) is positive at press time, reflecting the buying pressure in the market. This currently stands at 0.17.\n\nThe BoP measures the strength of buying versus selling pressure in a given asset by analyzing price movements within a specific period. When its value is positive like this, buying pressure is dominant.\n\nThis suggests a sustained bullish momentum in the OM market as buyers exert more control over the price action. If this persists, OM could reverse its current downtrend and climb toward $9.17.\n\nHowever, if OM maintains its decline, its price could fall to $5.16.\n\nQubic (QUBIC)\n\nLayer-1 (L1) coin QUBIC is another altcoin trending today. It currently trades at $0.00000092, marking an 8% price drop over the past day.\n\nDuring this period, its trading volume has spiked by 15%, totaling $2.29 million at press time. This confirms the surge in QUBIC selloffs among spot market participants.\n\nWhen an asset’s price declines while trading volume surges, it signals strong selling pressure as more market participants are actively offloading the asset. This indicates a bearish trend, suggesting that QUBIC holders are exiting positions.\n\nIf this continues, the price decline will continue. In this case, QUBIC could trade at $0.000000699.\n\nOn the other hand, if QUBIC witnesses a rebound, it could climb toward $0.00000106.\n\nToncoin (TON)\n\nTelegram-linked TON is another asset that has caught traders’ attention today. As of this writing, it trades at $3.57, noting an 11% price dip.\n\nOn the daily chart, the dots that make up TON’s Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) indicator lie above the price to form a dynamic resistance at $4.21.\n\nThis indicator identifies potential reversals by placing dots above or below price movements based on momentum. When the Parabolic SAR appears above the price, it signals a bearish trend, indicating strong downward momentum and suggesting a potential continuation of the decline unless a reversal occurs.\n\nIf TON’s decline continues, its price could drop to $2.82.\n\nConveresly, if demand surges, and TON rallies, it could break above $3.63 to sell at $5.22.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

As a result, investors are losing confidence, and the price may continue to drop further.\n\nPi Network Continues To Suffer\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) continues to show bearish signs, remaining well below the zero line. This indicates that the network is suffering from outflows, meaning that investors are moving their funds out of Pi Network. Despite a bullish start, Pi failed to sustain interest, leading many holders to sell off their positions.\n\nThe outflow trend is concerning for investors, as the lack of positive momentum suggests a prolonged downtrend. The market sentiment remains bearish, with sellers outweighing buyers. As the CMF stays in the negative zone, it signals that Pi Network’s price could struggle to find stability in the short term.\n\nThe Ichimoku Cloud, a widely used technical indicator, is hovering well above the candlesticks, signaling that the bearish trend is gaining strength. This indicates that there is little upward momentum in the market, and Pi Network is likely to face more downward pressure.\n\nAdditionally, broader market conditions are still negative, which suggests that Pi Network may fail to recover in the immediate future. With bearish technical indicators and a lack of support from investors, the outlook for Pi Network remains grim for now.\n\nPI Price Hits A New Low\n\nPi Network is currently priced at $0.61, having formed a new all-time low of $0.60 after dropping by nearly 14% over the last 24 hours. The altcoin continues to struggle under the weight of negative sentiment and is not showing signs of reversal in the near term.\n\nBased on the ongoing outflows and bearish technical indicators, Pi Network will likely continue its decline. It could fall further to $0.50, potentially forming new all-time lows. The current market conditions suggest that recovery is unlikely without a significant shift in sentiment.\n\nHowever, if Pi Network can bounce off the $0.60 level, it might regain some support and climb back to $0.87. This would help recover some of the recent losses and potentially give the altcoin another chance at a bullish move. But, without a strong catalyst, it may struggle to break through the resistance levels.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Bitcoin holds steady amid Trump’s tariffs, showing signs of maturing into a strategic, risk-dynamic asset rather than a speculative play.\n• Market turmoil and growing US recession odds may push the Fed toward money printing, spotlighting Bitcoin as a hedge asset.\n• Ethereum’s next moves will test crypto’s evolving stability, while recession fears and tightening regulations shape crypto's trajectory.\n\nWelcome to the US Morning Crypto Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.\n\nGrab a coffee to see how Bitcoin is holding its ground while Wall Street stumbles, why Trump’s tariffs may push the Fed into money-printing mode, and what that could mean for crypto’s next chapter. From Ethereum’s test of resilience to rising odds of a US recession, here’s everything you need to know to stay ahead.\n\nBitcoin Enters Its Risk-Dynamic Era Amid Tariffs and Turmoil\n\nBitcoin’s reaction to recent macro shocks—particularly Trump’s sweeping tariffs—has been noticeably calm compared to traditional markets, and that’s turning heads. While Wall Street stumbles harder than expected, crypto has held relatively steady.\n\nNexo Dispatch Editor Stella Zlatarev told BeInCrypto that this isn’t just resilience—it’s evidence that Bitcoin may be entering a new phase of market maturity.\n\n“A 2–3% drop in crypto is a rounding error compared to past cycles,” she said, emphasizing that this stability amid chaos suggests Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative punt. “Bitcoin’s ability to weather macro turbulence without the wild swings of previous years suggests institutional investors are treating it less as a speculative punt and more as a strategic asset,” Zlatarev said.\n\n“A 2–3% drop in crypto is a rounding error compared to past cycles,” she said, emphasizing that this stability amid chaos suggests Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative punt. “Bitcoin’s ability to weather macro turbulence without the wild swings of previous years suggests institutional investors are treating it less as a speculative punt and more as a strategic asset,” Zlatarev said.\n\nAnalysts also stressed that Bitcoin’s behavior doesn’t align with traditional asset categories.\n\n“It’s not gold, and it’s not the yen. Instead, Bitcoin is emerging as a risk-dynamic asset – one that doesn’t crumble like high-growth stocks but also doesn’t attract the same flight-to-safety flows as traditional safe havens,” Zlatarev told BeInCrypto.\n\n“It’s not gold, and it’s not the yen. Instead, Bitcoin is emerging as a risk-dynamic asset – one that doesn’t crumble like high-growth stocks but also doesn’t attract the same flight-to-safety flows as traditional safe havens,” Zlatarev told BeInCrypto.\n\nThis concept of a “risk-dynamic” asset positions Bitcoin in a unique role: something that thrives in uncertainty but doesn’t collapse when the market turns.\n\nZlatarev from Nexo also noted that how Ethereum and other blue-chip altcoins respond next will be key.\n\n“If ETH mirrors BTC’s performance, it strengthens the case that top-tier crypto assets are evolving into a more predictable asset class. If ETH wobbles, it reinforces that, for now, Bitcoin is in a league of its own.”\n\n“If ETH mirrors BTC’s performance, it strengthens the case that top-tier crypto assets are evolving into a more predictable asset class. If ETH wobbles, it reinforces that, for now, Bitcoin is in a league of its own.”\n\nMeanwhile, the macro backdrop is shifting fast. Trump’s new “Liberation Day” tariffs have spooked global trade partners and have also sent ripple effects through prediction markets. Polymarket now gives almost 50% odds of a US recession this year—a major shift following the announcement.\n\nAlso, CME FedWatch tool shows interest rate traders have boosted the probability the US Federal Reserve will make four rate cuts this year. Eventually, this could relief the current macroeconomic pressure on Bitcoin.\n\nFormer BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes mentioned that Trump’s current tariff strategy could complicate the US bond market. In other words, pressure is building for the Fed to intervene—possibly by turning on the liquidity spigot once again.\n\nTrump’s tariff formula is further evidence he is laser focused on reversing these imbalances. The problem for treasuries is that without $ exports foreigners can’t buy bonds. The Fed and banking system must step up to ensure a well functioning treasury mrkt, which means Brrrr. pic.twitter.com/doGPAaRfAl— Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) April 3, 2025\n\nTrump’s tariff formula is further evidence he is laser focused on reversing these imbalances. The problem for treasuries is that without $ exports foreigners can’t buy bonds. The Fed and banking system must step up to ensure a well functioning treasury mrkt, which means Brrrr. pic.twitter.com/doGPAaRfAl\n\nAll of this puts Bitcoin in a new spotlight. Its steadiness is no longer being dismissed as a coincidence. It may be the first sign that crypto, or at least its most mature players, is stepping out of the shadows of speculation and into the spotlight of strategic finance.\n\nChart of the Day\n\nBy reducing foreign demand for US Treasuries, Trump’s tariffs may force the Fed to inject more liquidity—potentially weakening the dollar and boosting Bitcoin as an alternative store of value.\n\nByte-Sized Alpha\n\n– Trump’s “Liberation Day” enforces 10%+ tariffs on all imports, hitting China, the EU, and Israel, triggering market drops and recession fears.\n\n– According to Standard Chartered, Bitcoin may hit $500,000 by Trump’s term end, AVAX could 10x by 2029, and Ethereum’s 2025 target drops to $4,000.\n\n– The STABLE Act of 2025 advances with bipartisan support, aiming to tighten stablecoin rules as competition and regulatory pressure intensify.\n\n– Bitcoin ETFs see $221 million in April inflows led by ARKB, but BTC derivatives cool with falling futures interest and bearish options sentiment.\n\n– DXY hits a 2024 low after “Liberation Day” tariffs, fueling short-term Bitcoin surge hopes amid global tensions and policy uncertainty.\n\n– Bitcoin struggles below $85,000 amid weak sentiment, but long-term holders stay firm, keeping capitulation fears at bay.\n\n– Polymarket sees almost 50% chance of US recession as Trump’s tariffs spark market fears and trade tensions.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• TRUMP token hit an all-time low of $8.97 following President Trump’s Liberation Day Tariffs announcement.\n• Negative funding rates and a shift toward short contracts reflect growing bearish sentiment in the market.\n• The RSI remains in the bearish zone, signaling potential further declines unless a major sentiment shift occurs.\n\nTRUMP token has faced a significant downturn, failing to recover after a recent decline. The altcoin’s price has been further pressured by the announcement of US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day Tariffs.\n\nAs a result, bearish sentiment has grown, leading traders to capitalize on the negative market conditions.\n\nTrump’s Announcement Took A Toll\n\nThe funding rate for TRUMP turned negative over the last 24 hours, signaling increased bearish activity. Traders are shifting to short contracts, betting that the price will decline further. This shift in sentiment follows the announcement of the tariffs, which, despite being a policy move, had a negative impact on TRUMP’s price.\n\nThis negative market reaction highlights traders’ skepticism about the future prospects of TRUMP. While the tariff announcement was meant to stimulate market reactions, it instead spurred fear, driving a wave of sell-offs.\n\nLooking at the broader momentum, technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveal that TRUMP is far from recovering its recent losses. The RSI remains firmly in the bearish zone, well below the neutral 50.0 mark. With no signs of reversal or bullish momentum, the token is likely to continue facing declines in the short term.\n\nThe oversold conditions are not yet reached either, indicating there is still room for further declines. With the RSI not showing any substantial recovery signals, the current downtrend could persist until market sentiment shifts or a new catalyst sparks renewed interest in the token.\n\nTRUMP Price Suffers\n\nTRUMP’s price hit a new all-time low of $8.97 before recovering slightly to $9.29. Over the last 24 hours, the token has seen a 10% decline. This drop has added to its month-long 45% slide, as the token lost crucial support levels, including $12.57 and $10.29.\n\nThe ongoing bearish trend suggests that TRUMP could continue to slide, with the next key support around $8.00. If the broader market conditions remain weak and the bearish sentiment continues to dominate, the price could dip further, reaching new lows before any potential recovery.\n\nHowever, if TRUMP manages to reclaim $10.29 as support, it could mark the beginning of a recovery attempt. Successfully breaching $12.57 could invalidate the current bearish outlook and signal a potential rally, but this would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and market conditions.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

The platform offers a permissionless decentralized framework for stablecoin development. It enables users to create yield-bearing, asset-backed, and overcollateralized stablecoins on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.\n\nThe addition of RSR to Coinbase’s listing roadmap has caught considerable attention, partly due to its association with Paul Atkins, President Donald Trump’s nominee for SEC Chair.\n\nAtkins previously served as a crypto advisor for the Reserve Protocol. He is widely regarded as a crypto-friendly figure—standing in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Gary Gensler, who oversaw a stringent crackdown on the industry during his tenure.\n\nNotably, the exchange’s move was celebrated by the platform.\n\n“Great to see more opportunities for people to participate in the Reserve ecosystem,” Reserve Protocol posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n“Great to see more opportunities for people to participate in the Reserve ecosystem,” Reserve Protocol posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nDespite the development, RSR’s price has shown only modest movement.\n\nAccording to the latest data, it was trading at $0.006. This reflected a 1.2% increase over the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the token has gained strong community support. CoinMarketCap data showed a 91.6% bullish sentiment among users. This indicated increased user confidence in its potential.\n\nEDGE Sees Triple-Digit Rally Post Coinbase Listing\n\nWhile RSR’s price showed only small gains, the EDGE token’s reaction has been much more dramatic. Coinbase revealed via X that it would list the Definitive platform’s utility token, EDGE.\n\n“Trading will begin later today if liquidity conditions are met. Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our EDGE-USD trading pair will launch in phases. Support for EDGE may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions,” the announcement read.\n\n“Trading will begin later today if liquidity conditions are met. Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our EDGE-USD trading pair will launch in phases. Support for EDGE may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions,” the announcement read.\n\nFollowing this, EDGE saw its price surge by an impressive 120.6% to $0.091. Previously, a similar reaction was observed in Doginme (DOGINME) and Keyboard Cat (KEYCAT) after they secured a listing on the exchange.\n\nEDGE’s listing, however, comes with an “Experimental” label. This is a designation Coinbase uses to indicate assets that may carry higher risk or volatility.\n\n“The Experimental asset label will not impact your ability to send, receive, buy, sell and/or hold assets on Coinbase. However, we do ask you to read and confirm you understand the risks involved, such as price swings and canceled orders, before trading an experimental asset for the first time,” the blog reads.\n\n“The Experimental asset label will not impact your ability to send, receive, buy, sell and/or hold assets on Coinbase.

These listings may provide new opportunities for investors. However, the associated risks should be carefully considered.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Onyxcoin (XCN) drops to a two-month low of $0.0088 as bearish sentiment and short interest rise.\n• XCN’s weighted sentiment remains negative at -0.031, signaling waning investor confidence.\n• With a long/short ratio of 0.95, demand for short positions suggests further potential declines.\n\nXCN has extended its prolonged decline by another day, slipping further into bearish territory. It now trades at a two-month low of $0.0088.\n\nWith waning bullish pressure and growing demand for short positions, the altcoin remains vulnerable to further losses.\n\nXCN Dips Amid Growing Pessimism\n\nXCN’s severely negative weighted sentiment since mid-February reinforces the lack of confidence in its price recovery. As of this writing, the metric stands below zero at -0.031.\n\nAn asset’s weighted sentiment measures its overall positive or negative bias, considering the volume of social media mentions and the sentiment expressed in those mentions. When an asset’s weighted sentiment is above 1, it indicates that the overall market sentiment towards the asset is favorable, with more positive than negative opinions or discussions.\n\nConversely, as with XCN, when the metric’s value is below 1, it is a bearish signal. It indicates pessimism among investors and signals that they are skeptical about the asset’s near-term outlook. This could prompt them to trade less, exacerbating the downward pressure on the asset.\n\nIf this bearish sentiment strengthens, XCN could face even deeper declines in the days ahead.\n\nFurther, the token’s long/short ratio confirms this negative outlook. At press time, it is 0.95, reflecting the high demand for short positions among XCN’s derivatives traders.\n\nThe long/short ratio measures the proportion of long positions (bets on price increases) to short positions (bets on price declines) in the market. A ratio below one like this means there are more short positions than long positions.\n\nIt indicates that traders are predominantly bearish on XCN, increasing the possibility of a continued price dip.\n\nXCN Under Pressure: Selling Momentum Could Push Price to $0.0048\n\nXCN has traded below a descending trend line since January 26. Currently trading at $0.0088, the altcoin’s value has since plunged by 78%.\n\nWith selling pressure gaining momentum, XCN could extend its decline. If demand remains scarce, the token’s price could fall to $0.0075, a low it last reached on January 17. Should the bulls fail to hold to this support floor, the token’s price could dip further to $0.0048.\n\nOn the other hand, a bullish reversal in the current trend could cause XCN to climb toward $0.011.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "full_content": "In Brief:\n• Fluence co-founder Tom Trowbridge's latest report outlines DePIN’s promising revenue-driven models and token economics.\n• The buy-and-burn mechanism decreases token supply, potentially increasing value and shielding DePIN from crypto market volatility.\n• Transparent, on-chain revenue verification and fiat payments offer stability, making DePIN more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nThe DePIN Token Economics Report, authored by Tom Trowbridge—co-founder of Fluence and host of the DePINed Podcast—offers an insightful analysis of the emerging Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN).\n\nDePIN combines crowdsourced infrastructure with crypto economics to provide useful services, making them similar to companies like Uber and Airbnb. However, unlike those centralized models, DePIN projects use tokens to compensate providers, and these tokens can appreciate as the network scales.\n\nDePIN Is Changing the Game with Revenue-Driven Models\n\nIn a March report, Tom Trowbridge argues that DePIN stands out as a promising and more stable approach to decentralized finance. Unlike speculative tokens like meme coins, DePIN aims to generate revenue through traditional customer-based business models, ensuring the project’s viability beyond the crypto space.\n\nThis approach offers a more predictable path to success and also has the potential to reshape the broader crypto narrative.\n\n“Traditional equity investors who historically have been unable to value the earlier generation of token projects will be interested in this traction and will bring a new level of diligence and a clear set of expectations when looking at DePIN token economics,”  Tom Trowbridge wrote in the report.\n\n“Traditional equity investors who historically have been unable to value the earlier generation of token projects will be interested in this traction and will bring a new level of diligence and a clear set of expectations when looking at DePIN token economics,”  Tom Trowbridge wrote in the report.\n\nTrowbridge further suggests that when DePIN projects gain substantial revenue from non-crypto customers, they could attract a new wave of institutional and retail investors. This shift would bring more attention to the token’s economics, adding a layer of scrutiny.\n\n“DePINs are on the cusp of generating substantial revenue from paying customers which, when combined with compelling token economics that drives value to their tokens, will attract investor attention to this segment of crypto,” Trowbridge said.\n\n“DePINs are on the cusp of generating substantial revenue from paying customers which, when combined with compelling token economics that drives value to their tokens, will attract investor attention to this segment of crypto,” Trowbridge said.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of DePIN token economics is the buy-and-burn mechanism. The strategy uses a portion of the revenue from the project to buy and burn its native tokens. Thus creating powerful deflationary dynamics.\n\nAccording to Trowbridge, this mechanism has the potential to decouple successful DePINs from the broader volatility of the crypto market. By burning tokens, the supply decreases, potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens.\n\n“DePIN revenue is not correlated to the crypto market, and DePIN is the only decentralized crypto sector to widely implement buy/burn. The potential impact on tokens will come as revenue scales independent of the crypto market dynamics, and the buy/burn dynamics become powerful,” Trowbridge argued.\n\n“DePIN revenue is not correlated to the crypto market, and DePIN is the only decentralized crypto sector to widely implement buy/burn. The potential impact on tokens will come as revenue scales independent of the crypto market dynamics, and the buy/burn dynamics become powerful,” Trowbridge argued.\n\nMoreover, a key challenge for many crypto projects is the lack of regulation, audits, and the potential for revenue overstatements. DePIN addresses this by offering a transparent on-chain verification system for its revenue.\n\nUnlike traditional financial audits, which can take weeks or months, DePIN’s model allows for immediate and more trustworthy public verification. This transparency ensures that investors can track real-time earnings, reducing the risks typically associated with crypto investments.\n\nTo further drive adoption, DePIN integrates fiat payments into its model, which helps mitigate the volatility of crypto rewards. Fiat-linked rewards provide stability for users, making the platform more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nDecentralized governance in DePIN projects employs various voting models to give stakeholders a voice. However, Trowbridge emphasizes the importance of safeguards against rogue votes, ensuring fairness and transparency in decision-making. For DePIN’s token model to succeed, he says simplicity is key.\n\nBy linking physical infrastructure with decentralized networks, leveraging economic models like buy-and-burn, and integrating fiat payments, DePIN is paving the way for a new wave of sustainable, revenue-driven crypto projects.\n\n“2025 will bring the launch of dozens of DePIN projects with a number of new token models, and we look forward to seeing the space continue to evolve,” the Fluence co-founder concluded.\n\n“2025 will bring the launch of dozens of DePIN projects with a number of new token models, and we look forward to seeing the space continue to evolve,” the Fluence co-founder concluded.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.
